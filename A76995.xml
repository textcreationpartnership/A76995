            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, Thou haſt here ſome of the beſt Phyſical pieces, of the beſt of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who is ſo well known through the moſt part of the world, for his excellent skill in the practice of Phyſick, for his ſingular knowledge of the ſecrets of Nature; for his candor in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating his Secrets and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments faithfully to the World, that I need do no more to commend theſe following Treatiſes to thee, but to tell thee, that they are <hi>Paracelſus's,</hi> who very well deſerves the Title of <hi>Princeps Medicorum,</hi> The chief Phyſician of the Microcoſm, and
<pb facs="tcp:170174:4"/> the beſt Anatomizer of the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm; for he hath brought out of its Bowels more of its hidden Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to the publick view, then any Phyſician or Philoſopher before or ſince his time; as it plainly appears by theſe enſuing Treatiſes, wherein you ſhall finde many Secrets worthy your knowledge: Here you have excellent Phyſical principles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Phyſician may be directed, both in his practice of Phyſick, and how to finde out Phyſical Secrets: Here alſo you have rare and moſt uſeful Experiments for the benefit of the ſerious, and very ſtrange ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets for the ſatisfaction of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. But theſe ſecrets have been much abuſed by many, who unjuſtly deſiring to have the praiſe of them
<pb facs="tcp:170174:4"/> from <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> have inſerted them in their own writings, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their own finding out: And to make the World believe this, they have ſet down thoſe ſecrets in their Writings ſo imperfectly, and ſo much varying from <hi>Paracelſus</hi> minde, that they are altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and falſe. Therefore thoſe who deſire to have theſe ſecrets truly and fully, let them hear <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> himſelf, ſpeaking his own minde in theſe enſuing Treatiſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Writings; let them reade them attentively and ſeriouſly, ſo as they may have his minde fully, and they ſhall finde theſe ſecrets true, which hitherto have been accounted vain and frivolous, as they have been (falſly) ſet down by others
<pb facs="tcp:170174:5"/> in their Writings.</p>
            <p>In Chymiſtry, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> was excellent, and indeed, Poſterity is much beholding unto him for revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Art ſo uſeful; for by this Art are made ſtrong Waters, Oyls, Spirits, and many excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, the which how uſeful they are, almoſt every one now knows: Yet this Art had been buried with the ancient Philoſophers, if it had not been for the great pains, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtudy of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who made it his chief care to bring this Art abroad into the World, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath been ſhut up in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets and ſecret Furnaces of Princes and Philoſophers; and hath taken off the vail which was left upon it by the Ancient Philoſophers, and
<pb facs="tcp:170174:5"/> hath diſcovered to us the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable uſes of it, and many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſecrets of it, never before known. And this he did, not for praiſe or gains, for he was a man free from ambition &amp; covetouſneſs, as all who knew him do acknowledge; the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing he aimed at in his actions when he was alive, and in theſe his ſurviving Writings, was onely the publick good; and becauſe of this his candor and faithfulneſs, and the excellency of his skill, he became an object of general envy; that both when he was alive, and now ſince his death, he hath been maliciouſly ſcandalized by many. And thoſe who knew not the truth of theſe things, taking upon truſt from the malicious, at firſt believed thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:170174:6"/> falſhoods, and afterwards they themſelves ſpake them as truths: So that it is doubtful whether <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> and his writings have had more wrong from the malicious, or from the ignorant; for thoſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals put upon <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> which have been invented by the envious, have been defended by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> what is here ſpoken in vindication of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> it is onely to give thee notice, that he is much wronged by many; and not that thou ſhouldeſt think him fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or his Writings infallible; for <hi>nullus ſine crimine vivit,</hi> and no doubt but he hath had his faults and errors, as well as other men; and thoſe none ſhould defend: but
<pb facs="tcp:170174:6"/> what is good in him, and fit for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſe, let none condemn. Many of his Philoſophical Opinions are not to be approved, but his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal practice is certainly very good; and whereas the truth of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Opinions, which muſt be found out by reaſoning <hi>(in abditis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſibus latet)</hi> is hardly found out; therefore <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> as moſt part of Philoſophers do, uſeth a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and a latitude in ſuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But let the Reader uſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion in reading, and be cautious in receiving ſuch Opinions; as in ſome of the following Treatiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of Corals, Secrets of Vermin, and St. Johns-wort, where he ſaith, That Coral and St. Johns-wort will drive away Ghoſts and evil Spirits
<pb facs="tcp:170174:7"/> from the place where it is, or from the perſon who carrieth it about them. And in the Treatiſe of the ſecrets of Vermin, he telleth us of ſtrange things which may be done by the tongue, tail, and skin of the Adder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are in deed very ſtrange, I cannot ſay much for the probability of them; neither can I ſay, that they are impoſsible: I am not of that minde, as many are, who conclude thoſe things to be impoſsible, or that they muſt be done by the Divel, which are extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and are ſuch things which they cannot underſtand. For I know, that God can do many things, and many things naturally, which we cannot underſtand how they are done, we onely can admire them;
<pb facs="tcp:170174:7"/> yea, God hath given underſtanding to ſome men how to uſe ſome natural things, whereby wonderful effects are done: Now when we ſee ſtrange things done, or hear that ſuch or ſuch ſtrange things may be done, ſhall we think that they cannot be done naturally, nor by God, becauſe we cannot underſtand how they are done? is any mans reaſon ſo reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo comprehenſive, as to know all that can be done by God and Nature? ſhall we ſay, that this or the other thing is not done naturally, becauſe it is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Principles which we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know? Is not this to binde God and Nature to our Principles, as if they cannot do otherwiſe then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Preſcriptions? O the<pb facs="tcp:170174:8"/> vanity of weak man to dote ſo much upon his own reaſon! Alas, how little is the greateſt knowledge that any man hath? and how much of that little is very uncertain? how many uncertain, how many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opinions in Phyloſophy? in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity? in every Art and Science? <hi>Quot homines, tot ſententiae.</hi> I have a little digreſſed, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to <hi>Paracelſus. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> Opinion concerning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Ghoſts, and many other his Philoſophick Opinions, which indeed are not ordinary; I do not approve them, nor will I here refute them: his Phyſical Practice I do approve, and doubtleſs, his cures and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Experiments which he hath left to us in his Writings (the beſt part
<pb facs="tcp:170174:8"/> of which are in the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes) are very good; as the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of many ſince his death, who have tryed them, do teſtifie to us, (viz <hi>Crollius, Baptiſta Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmont, Dorneus,</hi> and many other famous Phyſicians, who have followed his way altogether; yea, thoſe that profeſs that they will not follow his way, do nevertheleſs uſe moſt of his Medicines in their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as their Writings, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries can witneſs it;) And <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> in his life time gave proof thereof; for he did ſuch cures, which never any Phyſician hath done the like: He commonly cured thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which all other Doctors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted incurable; the truth of which is well known in all Germany, where
<pb facs="tcp:170174:9"/> he practiced; for he was Phyſician to the moſt part of the Peers and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and many other Nations, during his life; as all who knew any thing of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> yea, even his enemies do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; ſo that he cannot be defrauded of this praiſe. See <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> his Book, <hi>De Conſenſu, &amp; diſſenſu Peripateticorum, &amp; Chymicorum;</hi> and therefore I do admire, that any ſhould put th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ſcandal upon <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> to ſay, that he was a Mountebank, ſince all, even his enemies, do confeſs that he did ſuch great and ſtrange Cures. And certainly <hi>Baſil,</hi> which is one of the moſt famous Univerſities of the World, would never have choſen him to be their Publique Profeſſor of
<pb facs="tcp:170174:9"/> Phyſick, if he had been a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank or a weak man: He was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be their Profeſſor, when he was but thirty years of age, and there taught Phyſick publickly many years, and many came thither to hear his Phyſick Lectures from all parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> from <hi>Spain, Italy, France, Hungaria, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> in the aforeſaid Book. We alſo ſee many learned men approve of his way in the practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and have followed it; whereby it appears, that this man was no Mountebank, as ſome do enviouſly and falſly ſcandalize him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I thought it fitting to bint theſe things to thee, to prevent or remove thy prejudicial thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:170174:10"/> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> which may be bred by thoſe falſe ſcandals, which are too common in the mouthes of thoſe who know not the truth of theſe things, leſt by thy prejudicial thoughts of him, thou be deprived of the benefit of thoſe things which thou mayeſt meet with for thy good, in theſe enſuing Treatiſes. The Treatiſes of the Diſpenſatory, I have given you in <hi>Paracelſus</hi> own words: I have onely for thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit divided the Treatiſes into Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters; and to the Chapters I have added the Contents of them. But his Chirurgery I have abreviated; giving you onely the cures, with the marks of thoſe Ulcers and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthumes, for which he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cures. Very few of the
<pb facs="tcp:170174:10"/> remedies in the following Treatiſes are Chymical, but they are ſuch, as any may themſelves eaſily make them. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> Chymical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines you ſhall have alſo ſhortly in Engliſh altogether, with their Preparations fully and clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>

                     </gap>m, that whereas there are two ſorts of Hellebore, the one called Wh te, and the other Black; ſo diſtinguiſhed, not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170174:15"/> becauſe of the variety of their colours, but becauſe of the difference of their properties. Therefore, to ſpeak more truely and properly, if we would give them names according to their natures, then the white Hellebore ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the younger, and the black Hellebore ſhould be called the elder: For howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it theſe two are the ſame kind of herb, yet in this they differ, that the younger Hellebore ſhould be given only to young people, til they come to be of fifty years of age: the elder Hellebore is to be uſed only by thoſe who exceed fifty years.</p>
                  <p>And what I have now ſaid of Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, is to be underſtood of all other herbs and roots, which are of two kinds, viz male and female: Not that they are truly male and female; but by this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Phyſician is to underſtand, that the one kinde ſhould be given onely to young people, and the other to old.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, it is an exceeding great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in Phyſicians, that they have never taken notice of this, That Nature hath built two Shops, the one for young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the other for old: ſo that the ſame Medicine and Method of Curing is not for young people, which is for old. It
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170174:15"/> is very inconvenient, that thoſe who are old ſhould uſe the Medicines which are fit onely for young people: or that thoſe who are young ſhould uſe thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which are moſt agreeable with the conſtitution of old people.</p>
                  <p>To explain this further by an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Moon, which is every month renewed. The increaſe of the Moon from new Moon to full Moon, may be compared to the age of young people, and the decreaſe of the Moon from the full Moon to the new Moon, is like old age; ſo that in thoſe changes of the Moon are well repreſented unto us the ſeveral ages of man: and as the Moon hath not the ſame qualities in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, which ſhe hath in the decreaſe, ſo there is a great difference betwixt old and young people. Therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every Phyſician to ſearch through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the nature and condition of the Moon; and ſo he may know the age of a man, of what kind it is, which is to be learned by the Moon. She is the true and genuine book, and not that which is writ with ink. So that one kinde of the ſame herb ſhould be uſed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Moon, and another kind
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170174:16"/> in the decreaſe; and this is commonly called male and female, the male is the younger, the female the elder.</p>
                  <p>That you may better underſtand this, Obſerve, that as of every thing there are two ſorts, which are as two parts of one whole thing: ſo there are two kinds of Hellebore, the elder and youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: The elder Hellebore, what good can it do to young people? And how unfit is the younger Hellibore for old people? But having both kindes, we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Medicine for old and young; viz. the younger for young people, &amp;c. But ſeeing youth and old age cannot conſiſt together, even as the Moon cannot be both old and young at the ſame time; therefore God hath divided this Medicine into two parts, according to theſe two ages: and theſe parts are not tyed to one another in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, they do their work, the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other.</p>
                  <p>Again, we muſt obſerve the difference of diſeaſes in old age and in young: an Apoplexie is of one nature in young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of another in old; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be one Medicine uſed for this diſeaſe in thoſe who are young,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170174:16"/> and another for the ſame diſeaſe in thoſe who are old. Now in the two Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bores there is a perfect cure of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy; being uſed for the age to which they are proper.</p>
                  <p>So the Gout is of two kindes, there is elder and younger: Younger, viz. the Gout of young people; and elder, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z. the Gout of old people. For both theſe kindes of Gout there is a preſent Cure in Hellebore; but not in one and the ſame root of Hellebore: therefore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made a diviſion: Now be ever mindful of the difference of herbs, of the difference of ages, of the difference of Medicines, of the difference of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, of the alterations of the Moon. This is a myſtery and ſecret of Nature, which is evident to every Phyſician, who is a ſon of Aſtronomy.</p>
                  <p>Now that I ſhould ſatisfie Mounte-banks in every particular, there is no neceſſity: Nevertheleſſe, I will leave with you this ſerious Inſtruction; but I intend it chiefly for true Phyſicians, That the differences of things do ariſe out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf; ſo that every thing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to its own place, where it ſhould be: the Vertues of Medicines are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170174:17"/> where they ſhould have their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and they cannot be forced to any other way. So that the Medicine which is for young people, cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do good to old people.</p>

                  <p>I Conceive it fit that now I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the black Hellebore, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it to old age: whereby you may alſo know the nature of the white Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore.</p>
                  <p>And firſt to ſpeak of the preparation of black Hellebore, which was uſed by the Phyſicians in ancient times: it was thus; The Hellebore is to be pull'd up out of the ground when the Moon is in ſome of thoſe Signes of Heaven which are call'd Signes of Conſervation; then take the herbs and dry them in the ſhade with a dry Eaſt wind; afterwards beat
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170174:17"/> them to a fine powder with pure white Sugar of equall weight with them. So you have the Powder as it was made by the antient Phyſicians, who uſed all the wayes they could to get the true eſſence of this herb; but they could never do it, and therefore they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th this powder. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they ſo much ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ught after the eſſence of this herb, was this; becauſe they found by experience a wonderfull nature and property in this herb: for thoſe who were paſſed fifty years of age, by the daily uſing of the aforeſaid pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der evening and morning; taking ſo much at a time as they could take up with their three fingers, they became younger and more vigorous, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued healthfull and vigorous to the time of their death. This Vertue Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath myſtically contracted from the whole frame of the great world, for the conſervation of the little world Man. In this herb are comprehended the four Elements, and by it are expeld the impurities of the four Elements: it may well be called the Defenſive of old age.</p>
                  <p>But the aforeſaid powder is not to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170174:18"/> given to every one in a like quantitie: the perſons who are to uſe this powder, muſt take onely ſo much of it at a time as is moſt agreeable to their ſtrength, and as it ſhall be appointed by ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, they who ſought ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the true eſſence of this Herb, did it not raſhly; for what Herb is like to this? or what other herb can (as this) give a firm, vigorous, and laſting life to old age? For it preſerves us from all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infections, or inward putrifactions; and will keep a man alwaies in a good temper, that he ſhall come to old age without any ſickneſſe. And therefore it will be worth our pains, if we can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the pure Eſſence from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of this herb. Who will not ſay, but that ſuch a pure Eſſence is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Balſome; which can ſo preſerve a man till the time of his death, and in the operations of it agreeth with Balſom every way? Let not theſe things ſeem incredible to you.</p>
                  <p>By this Eſſence of Hellebore the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Gout are removed, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie quite rooted out; it will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any ſuch diſeaſe to be in the body.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170174:18"/> The Stars have certain times, and they who are born at ſuch times are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any diſeaſes: Again, the Stars have ſome other times, and they who are born at ſuch times are ſtill ſickly. Now, if according to Nature, Times can make ſuch impreſſion, and ſuch changes in man: Much more all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, which are brought forth by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they do agree with thoſe times of the Stars, and have a tincture from them; ſo that in ſome men, and in ſome Vegetables there is the ſame nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtamp of Conſervation: and ſo from ſuch Vegetables men may receive this tincture of Health.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much I have thought fit to ſpeak concerning the leaves of black Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore. This only I will add, That you muſt have a care to know how to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the pure Eſſence from the impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Hellebore under a right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation. How much more hurtful the diſeaſe is, ſo much more powerful the Medicine muſt be.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Cure of the Falling-ſickneſs with black Hellebore, and the ſeverall wayes of preparing it.</head>
                  <p>THe Root of this Hellebore cureth four Diſeaſes; viz. the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Gout, Palſie, Hydropſie. Here conſider the difference of Diſeaſes. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſe is twofold, viz. corporeal, or ſpiritual: For theſe two kindes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes the Phyſician muſt uſe two kindes of Cures; one for bodily, another for ſpiritual Diſeaſes. Concerning ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diſeaſes, and their Cures, having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them elſewhere; now in this place I ſpeak only of bodily diſeaſes. As for thoſe diſeaſes whoſe ſpirit is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in things bodily, and cannot ſubſiſt without thoſe bodies, their ſpirit dies with the bodie; But where there is an impreſſion from the Stars, there Art ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt of all in removing of that.</p>
                  <p>But now to come to our buſineſſe in hand, to ſhew you how thoſe four
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170174:19"/> Diſeaſes mentioned before, are cured by this Root.</p>
                  <p>There is to be obſerved a difference amongſt purging Medicines: Some of them purge ſlimie humours; which by purging do remove the humours, but do not impair the ſpecificall diſeaſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> they do not touch the diſeaſe it ſelf in the root of it. Hence it is that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſts, who ſay, that all diſeaſes come from the humours of the body; their whole Art conſiſts only in purging, and they do no good by it; but oft times miſerably kill diſeaſed perſons by it. If they knew the ſpecifical purging Medicines, then they were in the right way of purging.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Root of black Hellebore, Obſerve, that it purgeth two ways; it purgeth ſpecifically, and it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth groſs humors; by theſe two wayes it cureth the Falling-ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Here obſerve, that we ſhould be ſlow in purging groſs humours, (otherwiſe the ſick perſon may be much wronged) ſo as the Epileptick humour may be purged out with other humours. Therefore a Phyſician ſhould be skilfull in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Time, Order, and Manner of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170174:20"/> Phyſick according to the condition of the ſick perſon. In former times, thoſe who were troubled with the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſſe, were firſt to eat the Root it ſelf; afterwards they were to take it in milk, and laſtly they were to take it with other mixtures: but now (in our times) the Diſeaſe is more violent, and the poyſon of it more heightned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity the Phyſician muſt make his Phyſick ſtronger, left it be not able to overcome the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now I will give you my counſel, and ſhew you how this diſeaſe may be cured, as I have found by experience: Thus; Take the Root of Hellebore ſo ſoon as it is pull'd out of the earth, and put it in the ſpirit of wine, which wil bring out both the moiſture and the Oyl out of the Root; then the Spirit of wine being ſeparated from that Oyl, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the eſſence of the Root, ſweet, without any addition. This Eſſence doth much differ from that way which was uſed by the Phyſicians in ancient times: for this Eſſence doth not purge out a great deal of humours, but rather the Epileptick body it ſelf; <hi>i. e.</hi> the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein the Diſeaſe, or poyſon of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170174:20"/> the Diſeaſe chiefly lurks, which is the root of the Diſeaſe. Therefore this Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is a ſafer and more effectual purge, and a more certain cure, then that which was uſed in former times, againſt this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now this Eſſence will be more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual againſt this diſeaſe, if you join with it in the Spirit of wine, the Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of Oak, and Pellitorie, and the ſeeds of Pionie, that the medicinal ſpirit of theſe three may be mixed with the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Black Hellebore, and ſo to be given to the ſick perſon, ſo much of it at a time as the skilful Phyſician ſhall think fit. This diſeaſe muſt be driven out ſlowly and by degrees, conſidering the Nature of the ſick perſon, of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and of the Countrey where they live &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Addit.</hi> The Root is to be pull'd out of the earth in the decreaſe of the Moon, the Moon being in the Signe of <hi>Libra,</hi> (which Signe is moſt agreeable to the Falling-ſickneſſe) upon the Friday (or in an hour of <hi>Venus</hi>) and it muſt be dryed in the ſhade with a dry North wind. It was the cuſtome of the Antients to uſe the Herbs as they are pulld out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170174:21"/> of the earth, without any addition; but my way of uſing this Root is thus: Let the Patient who is troubled with the Falling-ſickneſſe be purged three dayes before the fit comes upon him, if it can be done, giving him for a purge two drams of the powder of this Root; to young people in milk, to old people in wine.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Another Preparation of the Leaves and Root of Hellebore.</head>
                     <p>Its certain, that the vertue of this herb is great and admirable, not much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Balſome. He which can bring out the Balſome which lurks in this herb, hath a moſt precious treaſure of Nature: The way to make of this herb a Balſome is thus: This herb muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified in its own water, being placed in warm dung, the glaſs being cloſe ſtop'd: afterwards the water muſt be ſeparated from that which is putrified, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified matter muſt be ſeparated from the grounds, the grounds muſt be kept by themſelves; then you have the Balſome with two degrees of moiſtneſſe, and twenty two degrees of putrifaction:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170174:21"/> The doſe of that which is putrified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to degrees; and of the water according to the quantity, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the adminiſtration of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt proceeding. This Balſome may be more exalted in its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, if the aforeſaid work be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by adding to this water and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied matter, new (or freſh) Hellebore; and if it be dry, eſpecially the Root, its ſo much the better.</p>
                     <p>The Root is thus corrected: Take of this Root cut in large ſlices two ounces, of fleſh a quarter of a pound cut very ſmall, of the water of Nutmeg one ounce, of the water of large Pepper one dram; put theſe together in a pot very well ſtopt, and put your pot in boyling water three or four hours; then take out your pot, and pour out the liquor, which you ſhall keep for your uſe; then throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fleſh and the herb. Of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor you are to give ſo much as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the ſick perſon, and neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Another Addition.</head>
                     <p>You have already heard that this Root cures four principall diſeaſes, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170174:22"/> that it is a conſervative of long life. But now I will ſhew you how Hellebore can do greater Cures then any I have yet mentioned: Take of this Balſome of black Hellebore one ounce, of naturall Balſome half a ſcruple; let them be ſo exactly mixed, that there appear but only one and not two: For Balſom and Hellebore are of the ſame nature in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Conſervation. Natural Balſom is ſuch a Medicine which preſerves us from all the infections of the Stars, from the Pluriſie, and from the Peſtilence: Now we ſhould provide Remedies not onely againſt our earthly infirmities and diſeaſes; but alſo againſt thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which come from the celeſtiall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: And againſt ſuch diſeaſes there is no Medicine more powerfull then Balſome.</p>
                     <p>If the Falling-Sickneſſe could be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by purging, then this Root were a ſufficient remedie. Some Herbs are fit purges for the Falling Sickneſſe, other herbs for the Jaundies, &amp;c. Every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe requires its own purge, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it; yet a Purgation is not a full Cure, we muſt do ſomething elſe to perfect the Cure: therefore when the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170174:22"/> Patient is purged ſo as he ſhould be; then follows the Cure of the Falling Sickneſs, which conſiſts in the Secret (or <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>) of the Eſſence of Coperas. By this method both old and young may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Nevertheleſſe, the Phyſician muſt obſerve, that this order of Purgations and Eſſences is not to be learned by the Apothecaries Art, but by the natures of things; which do teach us both the way how the Medicine is to be given, and how much is to be given.</p>

                  <p>THere are two kinds of Gout; one kind of it comes of bloud, the other comes of defluxions from the head.

                     </gap>oved Phyſicians gave Hellebore to thoſe who were troubled with ſuch defluxions, and with it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them. For this Root is the beſt of all purging Medicines which were known to the Ancients, both for preventing Defluxions, and for expelling them out of the body. This Purge was made by the Ancients, not according to the Rules of the Phyſicians of later times; but it was judiciouſly without curioſity prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: They regarded not ſuch Medicines which were made up of Syrups &amp;c. and ſuch other vaine additions. They gave this root alone, without any addition, to the patient, a little of it every day, and not all at one time: For Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be given moderately in long Diſeaſes; purging rather often and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170174:23"/> gently then violently. This Root of elder Hellebore thus prepared, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every day, as the Patient and Diſeaſe requires, doth ſo cure defluxions by its natural vertue, that no Root or Herb can do he like.</p>

Unskilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians do not conſider this, who uſe ſuch correctives as do weaken the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging faculty of this herb; they add to it Terra Sigillata, and other things which are contrary to the nature of this Herb, and take away the ſtrength of it; wheras it ſhould not loſe any of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues, but rather have them heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. But the true Correction of it, which beſt agreeth with Phyſick Rules, is thus: After the humour is purged out, you muſt do that which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the collection of the humour again.

                  <p>What I ſpeak of the Gout here, is only how to take away the Cauſe or the root of it by the Hellebore, which is the moſt conſiderable part of the cure. Therfore the purging power of this Root is not to be leſſened, but rather augmented. Then the beſt way of preparing it, is, as I have ſhewed before by the ſpirit of Wine: But uſe it what way you will, it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable purge. The patient muſt be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten purged by the aforeſaid root betwixt fits; for in ſo doing, thoſe defluxions which are the cauſe of the Gout, are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the whole bodie; ſo that in the time of the fit, the patient ſhall have but little pain. The ancient Philoſophers by purging often, cured every kind of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170174:24"/> Gout, even an old, ſetled Gout. But the Humouriſts, when they had thruſt themſelves into the number of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they preſumed to do more in an hour, then nature can do in a year, if they may be believed; and ſo this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine was caſt aſide and forgot.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170174:25"/>
                  <p>There muſt be a great quantity of this purge given at a time to thoſe who have the Palſie, ſo much as the ſtrength of the Patient can bear: for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is not eaſily driven out, we muſt deal with it violently. The Addition to be uſed beſides the Hellebore, for this diſeaſe, is ſet down in a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the Palſie.</p>
                  <p>They who are troubled with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropſie, muſt be purged ſlowly and gently; taking once every week ſo much of this Root as a skilful Phyſician ſhall preſcribe; and ſo the humour ſhall be by degrees purged away: firſt that which is upward, which is gathered about the breſt, ſtomack, lungs, liver, melt; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the humour which lyeth in the groins and hips is purged out; then the ſwelling of the feet and legs doth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; and laſtly the ſwelling of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls low. The humour is purged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in ſome Patients by Vomit, in ſome by Stool, in others by Sweat, in others by Urine. When the Patient is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purged by the Hellebore; then follows the Addition, which takes away the relicks of the diſeaſe, and makes up the full cure.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170174:25"/>
                  <p>The Addition is the Tincture of Steel: The Hellebore purgeth out the humour already gathered; the Tincture of Steel hinders any ſuch collection of humours to be afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude this Treatiſe of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore, which is a purge ſo excellent, that there is no other like it; for it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out whatſoever is in our bodies hurtful to us. There is nothing better then this Root to bring down womens monthly Courſes: it purgeth the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and driveth out untimely Births, falſe Conceptions, Worms, and every unnatural thing bred within the Womb.</p>
                  <p>Every purgative doth not bring down womens monthly Courſes, and expell Worms, and untimely Births, &amp;c. But this is above all others, a ſingular ſecret of nature: and if it be rightly uſed, it is ſo agreeable to the bodies of men and women, that whatſoever it meets with contrary and hurtfull to us, it will root it out.</p>
                  <p>That Doctor who knows the right uſe of this Herb and Root alone, without addition, ſhall by this one herb have more infallible knowledg and skill in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſeaſes, then all the Empericks or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170174:26"/> Doctors whoſoever, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence makes it appear abundantly.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who knew the right uſe of this Herb and Root in ancient times, lived to a great age very healthfully: but when the Humoriſts began to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, who contemn the ſecrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and judg of every thing according to their own ill-grounded theory, being without the true knowledg of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Nature, they found out their new way of Purgations, Clyſters and Syrups, &amp;c. whereby they raſhly thought to do as much in one day, as this Herb can do in twenty or thirty years; and ſo they brought this Herb to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and forgotten: bringing their own Purgations and Clyſters in the place of of it. I remember in my time, I have known many who have been much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Itch, Catarrhs, &amp;c. who uſing this Root after the way of the Ancients, were perfectly reſtored to health, their nature being thereby throughly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have known ſuch diſeaſes thus cured, which the Humoriſts could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cure, neither know they how to cure them; they can talk much, but cannot perform any thing. They took
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170174:26"/> every morning half a drachm, till they were three ſcore years of age: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, once in two daies half an ounce till they were ſeventy years of age; then afterwards every ſixth day to the end of their lives, one drachm.</p>
                  <p>Titulary Doctors need not admire, that Nature can do more then Art can do: He hath little Art who knows not what Nature can do. There is more to be found in this one herb, then is to be found in all the writings of Univerſity Doctors, for the prolonging of life. And I do delight in this Medicine of the Ancients, more then in any other Herb or Vegetable whatſoever, for the preſervation of long life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rſmart cureth all Sores both in man and in beaſts; alſo Wounds which being badly cured, are turned to Ulcers. There is no herb like this in curing Sores. If your horſe be extremely galled by the Saddle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſwell'd, or the skin broke &amp;c. if you apply this herb to the ſore, it will certainly cure it; and you may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe uſe your horſe either in riding, or &amp;c. in the time of curing it. So if any man be troubled with a hardneſſe of the skin in hands or feet; or if the skin
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170174:27"/> of their hands be chapped by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary labour, or the skin of their feet chapt by extraordinary travel: So thoſe who are in priſon, and tied with chains, if the chains do cut into their legs and arms, and ſo deſperate Ulcers do ariſe from theſe and ſuch like cauſes; then this herb is a certain remedie for them.</p>
                  <p>But now to ſhew you the uſes of this Herb: ſo ſoon as you have pull'd the Arſemart out of the ground, draw it through clean water; or draw it through the ſtreams of a River or a Spring, which is beſt of all; then lay it upon that part which is to be cured, ſo long as you may be eating up half an egg, then take it away and bury it in a moſt place, where it may rot, and as it putrifies, the ſore heales: ſome do ſigne the ſore with the ſigne of the Croſſe, and uſe a kind of a prayer for it: but ſuch doings are very impertinent and abſurd; for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the herb is naturall, not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious or magical. Therefore ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are to be rejected, and we ought to obſerve the naturall way, and ſo we ſhall finde this herb to be of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertue.</p>
                  <p>Many difficult ſores have been oft-times
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170174:28"/> cured both by me and by others, this way.</p>
                  <p>Now the cold water is the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the herb; the colder the water is, ſo much the better. The Arſmart being ſo cooled and wet, it ſhould be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſore; but if the ſore be heated by the herb, and begin to burn and ſtink, and to have more corrupt matter, then the herb muſt be taken off, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other freſh one muſt be laid to the ſore. This order and method muſt be kept till the Cure be perfected. And certainly, that ſore which cannot be cured by this Remedie, will never yeild to beyond-ſea Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Now this way of uſing this herb is confirmed by the light of nature: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf doth operate ſo, and not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way of uſing this herb, is in applying every day a freſh herb to the ſore: That this way is naturall, it is ſo evident, that it needs no proof. As for the firſt way, of which ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have not ſaid any thing to prove it to be naturall; I will ſhew it by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the like operation, betwixt the Loadſtone, and the needle of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170174:28"/> There is a power in the Load-ſtone to draw Iron to it in a wonderful manner, without hand or foot. Now if you would have the Load-ſtone to draw to it the needle of the Compaſſe, then the Load-ſtone muſt be rub'd to it; <hi>viz.</hi> the belly of the Load-ſtone muſt be rub'd to the belly of the needle of the Compaſſe; and the back of the Load-ſtone muſt be rub'd to the back of the needle of the Compaſs; and ſo the Load-ſtone will draw the belly of the needle of the Compaſs to its own belly. This is commonly known, and this is a ſingular myſtery and ſecret of Nature, whereby God in the light of nature doth admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhew his miracle.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſay, that there is the like agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the Arſmart and unfound fleſh, as there is betwixt the Load ſtone and the needle of the Compaſſe. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve then firſt, that there muſt be an union, <hi>i. e.</hi> an agreement betwixt the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated fleſh and this herb; ſo that the fleſh be touched and rub'd with this herb, as you have in the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of rubbing the needle of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe to the Load-ſtone; and where the Load-ſtone is, there is alſo a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170174:29"/> magnetick operation. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſore of man or beaſt be rub'd in the aforeſaid manner, by this herb, and afterward the herb be buryed in the ground, then the ſore ſhall be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cured by this herb.</p>
                  <p>If any do wonder at this, that the herb muſt be buried and covered over with a ſtone: I will therefore give you the natural cauſe of it; which is this: While the green herb is yet ſtanding in the ground, it hath no operation; for while it is alive, it operates with the Stars, and the Stars operate with it; and then it cannot be beneficiall to man. But when it is pluck'd out of the ground, then it is dead, and then the Stars do not operate with it, as living men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any dealings with dead men: and then its vertue is imparted to man, for whoſe uſe it was created.</p>
                  <p>Now this herb hath naturally this propertie, that while it is whole and not broken, ſo long the operation of it laſteth. As for example, Every man in this world hath his daily task which he muſt do; all the labour of man is onely a task: when his task is done, then he is dead, and death is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170174:29"/> the end of his daily task: So it is with this herb; it hath a task, and its task is to cure Sores: it is ſtill in doing this task till it be putrified, but when it is putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sore is cured, and then its task is done: therefore if it be a long time in putrifying, ſo the Sore will be a long time in curing; and if the herb be ſoon putrified, the cure is ſoon done. The Herb muſt be putrified in ſuch ground as it grew in. But if you would haſten the Cure, you muſt then take ſome courſe for a ſpeedy putrifaction. As it is in riding, if we would ſoon come to our journeys end, wee muſt put ſpurs to our horſe, ſo it is in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: if you would accelerate putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you muſt bury the herb in a moiſt fat ground, and lay a great ſtone over it; and ſo you ſhall have alſo a ſpeedy cure.</p>

                  <p>THis Arſmart is good, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Diſeaſes already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but likewiſe many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes may be helped by it. As, the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, which comes of a cold humour, is cured by this herb, if the herb be dipt in cold water, and laid upon the aking tooth: you may alſo bury it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a long time in putrifying, therefore the moſt common way of uſing it for the the Tooth-ach, is to lay it upon the aking tooth, ſo often as we are troubled with the pain. Many ſuch pains which come of cold humours or cold diſtempers, are by the burying of this herb, quite taken away, and we are never afterward troubled with them.</p>
                  <p>Arſmart hath alſo a peculiar Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick or a benumming faculty; it is a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170174:30"/> ſpeciall Remedie for all Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all pains of the head, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe phrenſie, and the like. And when the body is ſo inflamed by any diſeaſe, that it cannot be in greater torture, the beſt thing we can uſe to take away this heat and pain, is to eat Arſmart. Thoſe of ancient times, when they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this herb, they took away the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it by frying it with butter or oyl, and ſo did eat it; and being ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it cured thoſe diſeaſes for which it was intended.</p>
                  <p>And further, this Herb by its benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming faculty, is a Remedy for putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; it takes away the pains and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Lungs, Cough, pains of the belly, and riſings of the mother: being outwardly applied, it cureth that extreme inflammation called St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, and all other inflamed Ulcers; but it muſt be wet in Roſe-water before it be laid on. It cureth likewiſe all pains which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe of corroſive humours, or thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salts which are diſſolved in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which do cauſe moſt tormenting pains. Now where theſe corroſive or ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh humors are, as in the teeth, they cauſe the Tooth-ach: in the finger they cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170174:31"/> the Felon, &amp;c. If you lay this herb up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſeaſed part, uſing it that way as hath been ſhewed before, then it will certainly perform the Cure, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Narcotick remedies cannot do it.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>An Addition, more fully explaining how this herb ſhould be uſed for Wounds, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THat you may be fully inſtructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of this Herb, I have thought fit to add ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that firſt way of uſing it, which I have before declared to you by the example of the Load-ſtone. I told you before, that this herb muſt be drawn through cold running water, and the freſh herb being cold and wet, muſt be laid upon the Ulcer, Wound, &amp;c. and then preſently it muſt be taken off again, and buryed. Now the thing which I add here, is this: If the diſeaſe or other griefs accompanying the diſeaſe, be ſo violent and ſtrong, that they will not eaſily yeeld to the Remedie, then do thus: Lay to the ſore every morning a freſh herb, after it hath been drawne through running water, then take it and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170174:31"/> bury it: and thus you muſt do three mornings, and oftner, if need be: if you ſee the diſeaſe very hard to cure, then you may do ſo twelve or fourteen mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, yea every morning till the cure be perfected.</p>
                     <p>If a man in his journey be hindred, becauſe his horſe hath received ſome hurt, or is extremely galled, then lay this herb to the ſore, and do as I have now ſhewed you: if he be not well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt, ſecond, fourth &amp;c. dreſſing, yet you muſt continue this courſe till he be well. Troubleſome or violent diſeaſes muſt have powerfull remedies, and muſt be diligently look'd to. And ſeeing in ſome diſeaſes the aforeſaid way of uſing this herb doth little good at firſt; as one Purge, or if the quantity of the purge be too little, it doth little good in ſome diſeaſes; therefore I have thought good here to ſhew you how the firſt way of uſing this herb may be made ſo effectuall, that there is not any ſore whatſoever, but it may be throughly cured by it.</p>
                     <p>Again, you muſt remember, to keep Wounds and Ulcers clean: if you do it not, you wil much hinder the Cure.</p>

                     <p>Again obſerve, That other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be joyned with this Herb, ſuch as are ſutable to it, and are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ordained to ſuch Cures; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with it, may further the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick vertue of it.</p>
                     <p>Again, there is one great ſecret in this herb which I will not hide from you; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cure which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by this Herb is a certain and laſting Cure. You need not fear that an Ulcer, &amp;c. cured by this Herb, will break out again: and it is ſuch a Cure as Nature requires. This magnetick Herb doth not cloſe up that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have open; nor will it leave that open, which Nature would have cloſed. As for example; Where there is a paſſage for the effluxion of humours; eſpecially if there be a great deal of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which purgeth out, ſo as if ſuch a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170174:32"/> paſſage ſhould be ſtopd, death would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; now this herb will not ſtop ſuch a paſſage, which ſhould not be ſtop'd; it only cures that which Nature would have cured: it will not do any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or hurtfull to Nature. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that this way of cure done by this herb is moſt natural.</p>
                     <p>If you would know how to uſe this herb for the Tooth-ach; take ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmart, and ſome of the bark of Henbane, boil them together in Roſe-vinegar; when they are boiled enough, take them out and bury them in the ground; but the liquor you muſt take and waſh your mouth with: you muſt take it as hot as poſſibly you can, and hold it in your mouth till it be cooled; then put it out of your mouth; and take ſome more of this liquor as hot as you did before, and hold it in your mouth till it be cooled: and thus if you do many times together, you have a certain cure for the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach: or you may take the herb it ſelf not boyled, and rub it upon the tooth, and bury it, and when it is putrified, the pain of the tooth will ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Correction of this Herb for thoſe inward Diſeaſes, which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170174:33"/> before is thus: Let the Arſmart be boiled in the water of Night-ſhade, or in the water of great Sengreen: the decoction is to be drunk, and the herb it ſelf muſt be buried, as hath been ſaid before. And you may do ſo likewiſe with it for outward diſeaſes, adding a little Camphire to it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all that we have yet ſpoken concerning Arſmart, there is yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great and excellent ſecret. But I conceive it better to be ſilent, then to ſpeak any more now concerning this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jewel.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ed Corals are of two kinds: one kinde of them is of a dark red colour, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a purple colour: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of them is of a bright, ſhining red colour, And as they differ in colours, ſo they differ in properties. There is another kind of a pale colour, which hath very little ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it. It is to be obſerved concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the red Coral, that how far ſhort it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170174:34"/> is of a bright reddiſh, it wants ſo much of its goodneſſe and efficacy.</p>
                  <p>Experience teaches us, that thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals which are of a clear, bright, ſhining red colour, full of boughs, and no where broken, are full of power and vertue: But thoſe Corals which have clefts, or want any part which they ſhould have, are of leſſe vertue. As a tree which wants ſome of its boughs, brings forth the leſs fruit; ſo Corals, whether purple, or bright red, if they want any of their parts, they likewiſe want ſome of their vertue.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak of the ſeveral proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe two kinds of Corals; <hi>viz.</hi> the bright red, and the purple or dark red.</p>
                  <p>The bright red are pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable; but the dark red are not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eye. Thoſe who would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about them Corall, if they be young men, or old men, let them chuſe and love the bright Coral; and they muſt beware of the dull, dark Coral. As joy differs from ſorrow, and laughing from weeping; ſo theſe two ſorts of Corals differ the one from the other. A ſick or weak man, who would have his heart
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170174:34"/> merry and joyfull, if he carry about him the dark red or purple Corall, it will increaſe his diſeaſe and ſadneſſe of heart.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak of the vertues of the ſhining, bright red Coral. It is good to quicken Phanſie, or imaginative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; its good againſt Phantaſms, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal ſpirits; Its good againſt vain viſions, or vain ſights, call'd <hi>Spectra.</hi> Its good againſt Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>I will explain theſe a little to you, that you may thereby know better the worth and uſe of theſe Corals.</p>
                  <p>That you may underſtand what <hi>Phanſie</hi> is: Conſider how ſome men are naturally inclined to the ſtudie of Secrets, of Arts and Sciences, and new Inventions. Now they cannot alwaies finde out theſe things ſo readily as they would, they tire their mindes and thoughts about it: the bright Corall will be very helpfull to us in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; for it will not ſuffer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or any thing elſe which will ſeduce a man in his Phantaſie to infect his mind with impurity, wickedneſſe or vanity. But the dark red Corall doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170174:35"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phantaſms,</hi> or nocturnal Spirits, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Nature, they have a little of mans underſtanding in them; they ſeek after man, eſpecially him who is joyned to them. They be of divers ſorts, ſome good, ſome bad; they are lovers of man, but not viſibly, and they converſe with them as dogs: but there is nothing to be got by theſe Spirits; they can do nothing, except it be to trouble a man: they fly from theſe bright Corals as a dog from a ſtaff; but they gather together where the dark colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Coral is. They are much like to the Night-mares, which are bred of Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Spectrum</hi> or a Ghoſt is the Starry body of a dead man. Man hath a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold body; one made of the Elements, the other made of the Firmament. The body made of the Elements, when the life leaves it, it rots in the place where it is buryed: but that other body which man hath from the Stars, flyeth up and down in the air above the earth. Now theſe aetheriall or Starry bodies of dead men we call Ghoſts; which cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be where the bright Coral is; but the dark coloured Coral allures them to it.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:170174:35"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melancholy</hi> is a diſeaſe which makes a man ſad whether he will or not; that he grows weary of every thing, and become dull: and by his diverſe thoughts and ſpeculations makes him grieve and weep. This Melancholy is driven away by the bright red Coral, and it is encreaſed by the dark red Coral.</p>
                  <p>It is evident then, by theſe four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars now mentioned, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Coral is naturall, and not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious or magicall, as many may think; for theſe four, of which we have now ſpoken, do proceed from Nature, and not from the Divel, contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now if they be natural, as Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, and the compoſition and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of man proves it, then Nature hath a ſecret prepared for them, as it hath for all things naturall, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Nature. Now Coral is one of thoſe Secrets, of which there are alſo ſome others, which Nature hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt theſe four. And ſo Nature is contrary to nature; that is, contrary to nature in aſſiſting Nature,</p>

                  <p>The Proof of this. If we by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can find out a way to build a houſe over our heads to keep off the rain, or to make a ſhade to keep off the heat of the Sun, &amp;c. So Nature, as it can cauſe Tempeſts in the air; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it can alſo prepare a defenſive to ſave from the harm of theſe Tempeſts. As for example; as Nature cauſeth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſo likewiſe it hath prepared Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines againſt thoſe diſeaſes. So that there is not any naturall thing but hath its contrary, that is, there is created
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170174:36"/> ſome naturall thing which is contrary to it: and for this end God hath created Corall, who underſtands theſe things; and hath likewiſe created other ſuch things out of the earth.</p>

                     <p>Bright red Coral doth defend us from the cruelty of ſavage monſters, ſuch as are bred by the Heaven, that is, the Stars, contrary to the courſe of nature.

                     <p>Divels or Spirits which would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe men, they cannot do it where Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is; if the Corall be lying in the place, or be hid in a fit place, or if we carry it about us. There be many ſuch Spirits inviſible with us, which ſeduce us, and teach us to lie, and to deceive, &amp;c. but by this Corall they may be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away from us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Proof.</hi> As the Divel flieth from the Sun which he cannot endure; for he hates the light, and loves darkneſſe; ſo he flieth from this Coral, which God hath ſingularly enriched, more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vegetable; even as he hath made the Sun to excell all the reſt of the Stars.

                     <p>Where this Coral is, whether in the Fields or in Gardens, there all kinds of fruits are multiplyed and increaſed: it likewiſe drives away from thoſe grounds (where it lyeth) all ſuch Birds, Vermine, Spirits, Ghoſts, which are hurtfull to the grounds, or the fruits of the grounds, and ſo it increaſeth the fruits. For the corn, fruits &amp;c. receive great damage in the night by Spirits and Ghoſts.</p>
                     <p>Further, if the Divel may poſſeſſe man, much more he may poſſeſſe beaſts, as Cows, Dogs, Hogs, Birds, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch beaſts in which men have moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

And that Corall in which you cannot diſcern this back and belly wanteth much of the vertue which it ſhould have; or if it wanteth any boughs which it ſhould have, then its defective in its vertue; for the more boughs and branches it hath, it is ſo much the better.

                     <p>It hath been alwayes the cuſtome of Philoſophers to ſeparate the good from the bad, the pure from the impure; that is, all things muſt die; onely the ſoul continueth: and if the ſoul doth not die, and the bodie muſt rot, hence then it follows, that the ſeed muſt putrifie before it can bring forth fruit. Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is incident to the body: onely the Eſſence, that which is good, the ſoul, doth not putrifie.

                     <p>I deny not, but ſome things may be added to this Eſſence of Coral, which may better it; as the ſecret Eſſence of the ſtone Carneolus, which makes the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Coral more efficacious in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of fluxes, as bleeding fluxes of the belly, &amp;c. Another thing which may be added to this Eſſence, is the glaſſe of Steel made liquid; which makes the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence very powerfull in curing the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſickneſſe. The eſſence with theſe additions may be rectified in a Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory veſſel; not the Circulatory veſſel of the vulgar Alchimiſts, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Alchimiſts, and can do nothing but prate.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The vertues of S. Johns wort for phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Spirits, worms and wounds.</head>
                  <p>I Have oft-times declared, how by the outward ſhapes and qualities of things we may know their inward Vertues, which God hath put in them for the good of man. So in St. Johns wort, we may take notice of the form of the leaves and flowers, the poroſity of the leaves, the Veins. 1. The poroſitie or holes in the leaves, ſignifie to us, that this herb helps both inward and outward holes or cuts in the skin, and ſtrengthens Nature in expelling that which ſhould be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated through the pores of the skin.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170174:41"/> 2. The flowers of Saint Johns wort, when they are putrified, they are like blood; which teacheth us, that this herb is good for wounds, to cloſe them and fill them up. 3 The ſtraikes in the leaves like veines, ſhew us, That this herb drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from a man Ghoſts and night-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſpirits begot by imagination, whether they be within a man or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and theſe phantaſtick Spirits, which are begot by Phanſie, do beget Ghoſts, ſo that a man ſhall ſee ſpirits, viſions, and hear ſuch phanſies: and all theſe are naturall effects; they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which bring men to dotage and madneſſe, and make men ſometimes to kill themſelves. 4. By the whole herb we may know this, that if there be any of the aforeſaid evils in any part of man, it ſhall be expell'd by this herb; ſo that this herb is an univerſall medicine for the whole man. Laſtly, The taſt of this herb is unpleaſant to worms, therefore the worms do hate it.</p>
                  <p>You may obſerve four vertues which are in St. Johns wort; viz. for Wounds, Worms, Spirits, and its Balſome-ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Concerning theſe Phantaſms, or phantaſtick ſpirits, which are without
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170174:42"/> body or ſubſtance, they are a diſeaſe, which in the ſpirit of contemplation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get another ſpirit, whereby the man is governed. The which ſpirit begets in a man ſuch thoughts and geſtures as are contrary to his nature. And for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe there are no more remedies known that are created by God, but only Coral and St. Johns wort. Let the Phyſician here take notice of this, that this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm or phantaſtick Spirit is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe proceeding of Melancholy; as the Univerſity Doctors fain: but it is a ſpirit which cannot be driven away by thoſe things which cure Melancholy; but only by ſuch Remedies in which there is a power and ſtrength to drive them away by force.</p>
                  <p>Such a vertue as this is not to be found in thoſe compounded Receipts which are made by the Apothecaries: but it is a Medicine made by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without a Phyſician: it is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made wholly by Nature. And therefore when wee would uſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Phantaſmes, we muſt take it alone without addition or compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>There be divers ſorts of Wormes:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170174:42"/> there be ſome Worms to which Rue is an enemy; there be others to which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica is an enemy &amp;c. and others to which St. Johns wort is an enemy, not only becauſe of the taſte, but becauſe of that vertue of St. Johns wort; which as it is an enemy to all phantaſtick Spirits; ſo it is alſo contrary to the ſpirits of worms, and all vermin, which by their naturall inſtinct do hate and fly from this vertue of St. Johns wort. As the ſun-beam pierceth through glaſſe; ſo this vertue pierceth through the Spirits of men and beaſts, even as musk, which by its ſmell gets into the inmoſt part of the brain. Therefore worms fly from this herb, and leave the place where it is. This herb is alſo good for wounds, not as it is in it ſelf, but if it be rightly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And let every Surgeon know, that there is not any herb in all <hi>Germany,</hi> or in any other Nation, whoſe vertue by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration can be ſo much exalted for the curing of wounds as St. Johns wort: and this vertue being ſo exalted cannot be fully deſcribed. There is no other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which can cloſe up a wound ſo ſoundly and perfectly, without any harm which may follow thereupon, as St. Johns
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170174:43"/> wort. Indeed, there is not a more wholeſome herb and better for Wounds to be found upon the earth, then Saint Johns wort.</p>
                  <p>All the Books that ever have been written concerning the cure of Wounds, being compared with this herb, they are vain and uſeleſſe, and have nothing in them but vain talk. For the greateſt vertue and foundation of a vulnerary Cure is to be found in this herb; and by it there may be a Balſome made whoſe vertues may contend with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Balſome: not that there is any natural Balſome eſſentially in it; but by preparation, as it ſhall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhewed. Every underſtanding Phyſician will take theſe things well which I ſpeak here: for there are more and greater things taught in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then in all the Chirurgery of <hi>Galen</hi> er <hi>Avicen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> When the St. Johns wort muſt be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the ground, and how it muſt be uſed againſt Phantaſtick Spirits.</head>
                  <p>WHen we would uſe Saint Johns wort againſt theſe Phantaſms, we muſt obſerve the time of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Influences, which is moſt contrary to theſe Spirits; and it is chiefly in <hi>Mars,</hi> or in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or in <hi>Venus:</hi> it is to be done not with the Moon, but againſt the Moon; not in the afternoon, or after Sun-ſet; but a little before Sun-riſing, or in the dawning of the day, in a place looking towards the Eaſt, in a place where many other good herbs and flowers grow; Saint Johns wort growing in ſuch a place is the beſt: and the longer it is, and the more flowers it hath, it is ſo much the better. It is to be pull'd up when it hath flowers: and then carry it conſtantly about you as a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170174:44"/> Noſegay; or you may carry it in your cap, or in your boſom: in the night time you may lay it under your pillow: hang it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the chamber; and you may hang ſome of it in every room of your houſe.</p>
                  <p>And let all Phyſicians be aſſured of this, that God hath hid a great ſecret in this herb; eſpecially againſt Spirits and ſuch Phantaſms which make men mad, and bring them to diſpair; which are not from the Divel, but from Nature. For God hath created for every diſeaſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy proper to it; therefore it is the duty of the Phyſician to learn and to ſearch out where God hath hid ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>When the St Johns wort muſt be pulled out of the earth; and how it ſhould be uſed for Worms.</head>
                     <p>St. Johns wort needs no correction for the worms; but we ſhould uſe it as God himſelf hath made it for us. It ſhould be pull'd out of the earth the Moon being in thoſe Signes wherein ſhe is when trees are lop'd or cut down, or when Argoile is dig'd up; in which Signs no worms or moths can be bred.</p>
                     <p>Now this herb being thus pull'd up, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170174:44"/> you lay it to wounds in which there are worms: as it ſomtimes falls out through negligence or the unskilfulneſs of the Chirurgeon. It is ſomtimes the effect of nature it felf, eſpecially in the Summer time, in the dog-dayes; but oft-times im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent remedies are the cauſe of it. I have ſeen in the winter time worms breed for three weeks together in wounds; ſo that in the evenings and mornings oft-times there hath been an handfull of worms taken out of the wounds, becauſe thoſe wounds were choak'd: but by St. Johns wort wounds may be kept free from worms; for ſo ſoon as it is laid to the wound, the worms fall out; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if worms be bred by ſome putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any other place of the body; then lay St. Johns wort upon your navell, and it will make theſe worms remove, and hinder the breeding of them.</p>
                     <p>But here obſerve, that St. Johns wort can do no good againſt thoſe worms w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are not bred by putrifaction (as there are ſome wormes which are not ſo ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) and therefore a skilfull Phyſician ſhould obſerve, whether they are from putrifaction or not. As for example, you ſee worms generated in cheeſe, theſe are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170174:45"/> taken away by this herb; ſo alſo in fleſh; and ſo it may have the ſame operation in man. Therefore if there be Worms in any part of the body, lay this herb upon the navell, or upon the skin over againſt the place where the Worms are, and it will make them remove: and being removed once out of their place, they may by a ſlight purge be quite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out: For the chief thing to be done againſt the Worms, is to make them remove out of their place; which is done moſt powerfully by Saint Johns wort.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How the St. Johns wort ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Wounds, Bruiſes, Fractures of the bones and Ulcers: and how it ſhould be uſed when it is prepared.</head>
                  <p>THe moſt ſubtile and certain way of preparing Saint Johns wort, ſo that its vertue may be moſt exalted, whereby all Wounds &amp;c. may be cured, is thus: Firſt you muſt have the oyl of the ſeeds
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170174:45"/> of St. Johns wort; to which add a like quantity of Turpentine, then boil theſe two together in good claret wine an hour; afterwards put to them half ſo much of good new ſallet oyle, and let them boile all together ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hour in claret wine: then put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the leaves of Saint John wort, ſo much of them till the liquor can hardly cover them: then let all theſe boyle together in the claret wine ſix hours, till all the wine be conſumed, and there remains only the leaves, the two Oyles and the Turpentine; which you ſhall take and ſet them in the Sun a month.</p>
                  <p>If you add to this Medicine the flowers of Centory, Maſtick, Incenſe, Mirrh, Mummie, and ſo repeat the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, boiling them all together in the wine, and afterwards to ſet them in the Sun, this medicine will ſo be made much better.</p>
                  <p>Another way of proceeding worthy your obſervation, is thus: Take diſtilled Turpentine, and put into it a good quantity of the flowers of Saint Johns wort, and let them ſtand in the Sun a month; then put the ſeeds of St. Johns
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170174:46"/> wort into this Turpentine, and ſet them in the Sun a month; then put to this diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Turpentine, half ſo much of waſh'd Turpentine, and let them ſtand in the Sun a month; and ſo you have a Balſom which is a ſingular Remedie for the wounds of veins and nerves; preſerving them from decaying, and bringing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again thoſe parts of the nerves and veins which by the wound are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that there is no need of ſowing. And laſtly, it prevents the contracture and reſolution of the nerves, which are ſometimes effected by wounds.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes men receive wounds when the Moon is in evill ſignes, which makes a ſlight wound become deadly. Now when you are to deal with ſuch wounds which are not deadly becauſe of the part wounded, or becauſe of the greatneſſe of the wound; but becauſe of the evill ſigne. You may cure them by this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Balſome.</p>
                  <p>Take of the <hi>Oleum Lacarinum,</hi> and put into it the flowers of S. Johns wort: Let them ſtand in the Sun ſix days; then take out thoſe flowers, and put in freſh flowers, and ſo let it ſtand ſix dayes more in the Sun: thus you muſt renew the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170174:46"/> flowers ſix or ſeven times, and every time the oyl with the flowers muſt be ſet in the Sun ſix dayes: ſo you ſhall have a Balſom far exceeding all others in curing deadly wounds.</p>
                  <p>But there remains yet another kind, of a Balſome-nature, which may be drunk: which is indeed the beſt vulnerary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if it be taken for thruſts or inward wounds of the body, whereby the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts are wounded. There cannot be ſuch another vulnerarie Potion made. The Potion is made thus:</p>
                  <p>Take of the white oyl of Juniper, of the oyl made of the ſeeds of St. Johns wort one quart. Put into theſe two oyls the flowers of St. Johns wort; let them be ſet in the Sun: and proceed in the ſame manner as hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, renewing the flowers, and then ſetting them in the Sun; the oftner you do this, the better will the Potion be; and what this Potion cannot do, there is no other remedie can do it in wounds.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Receipts I have given you for this end, that you may know, that none of the Phyſicians trouble themſelves to find out ſuch ſecrets: they ſel fair words &amp; large promiſes to ſick people; but how
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170174:47"/> often do they make ſlight wounds turn to be bad wounds, and bad wounds to become worſe, and ſo miſerably deſtroy their patients. But that they may not do ſo any more hereafter, I therefore have told them theſe my Remedies, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that if they uſe theſe my Remedies, many untimely deaths may be prevented. Indeed, it is a ſad thing that man who is the image of God, ſhould through the great raſhneſſe and unskilfulneſs of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians be often deprived not onely of their health, but alſo their life. Whereas there are many perfect remedies created by God, which ought to be uſed in ſtead of thoſe miſerable Remedies of theirs.</p>
                  <p>Now I will ſhew you how the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Balſoms and Potion ſhould be uſed. You muſt lay ſoft lint, or the ſcrapings of linnen in the wound, and lay it over all the wound, if you can; then drop the Balſome warm into and over all the wound. By this means the wound ſhall not become dry, but alwayes be kept moyſt.</p>
                  <p>The Potion muſt be taken in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at noon, and at night: and each time you muſt take two ſpoonfuls of this potion in twenty ſpoonfuls of wine:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170174:47"/> and ſo you muſt take every day ſix ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of this Potion, till the Cure be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>All the aforeſaid Receipts partake of the nature of Balſom; for they will not let any thing rot which hath any life in it. Here mark the difference of Balſoms: There are ſome Balſoms which preſerve dead bodies from corruption; and there are ſome Balſoms which do not preſerve dead bodies, but preſerve living bodies from corruption, that they ſhall not be troubled with Ulcers or Apoſthems &amp;c. Now where is there a Phyſician who hath ſuch a Remedie in readineſs, which can ſo preſerve us from putrifaction, that no part of our living body ſhall putrifie; that can do as this herb of which I now ſpeak?</p>
                  <p>Now I will teach you a way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, which is thus: Add to the firſt Balſome deſcribed before, Treakle, and the beſt Mithridate, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diaphoreticks; then having put them into a glaſs cloſe ſtopped, ſet the glaſs in warm dung there to digeſt ſome time, viz. a month, and then uſe it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover know this, that you may diſtill a water from this Herb and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170174:48"/> flowers of it in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled water can do the ſame things as the St. Johns wort it ſelf. But this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſo powerfull; and it is to be uſed only for ſuch wounds which are not very dangerous or difficult. It may be both taken inwardly, and applyed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>But the former Balſoms of the S. Johns wort can cure any broken bones, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bruiſe, or clotted blood in the body. Thus I have thought good to declare this my experience of St. Johns wort, that vain Receipts may be rejected, and true Remedies may be uſed. But indeed, ſuch is the madneſſe of Bath keepers, Surgeons &amp;c. that they would rather deſtroy a whole Army of men, then to leave their old mad Remedies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee ſee in the Load-ſtone an attractive power, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in a wonderfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beyond humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it draws to it ſelf Iron and Steel, and other things. This operation of the Load-ſtone may be plainly ſeen, and it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to any Phyſician: Why then doth not the Phyſician conſider this; Whether or no there may not be other uſes of the Load-ſtone. But Phyſicians are ſo greedy of gain, that they neglect all ſuch experiences: which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170174:49"/> well excuſe, ſeeing they have ſuch an excellent ſubject as this in their hands, and they cleerly ſee the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it with their eyes, and yet ſhould be ſo dull and ſlow in knowing it, and in finding out the Vertues of it. And if I ſhould collect out of antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all that they have ſaid of the vertues of the Loadſtone, yet I ſhould do no great matter: for he who writes of the Loadſtone, muſt ſhew what things ſhould be added to the Loadſtone, and what things can correct it: ſo that I ſhall go beyond all thoſe Phyſicians in this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Doctors and Apothecaries do often (even to my loathing) repeat to me, that I reject the Authority of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Writers. But why ſhould I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe who have no experience? for you ſee that what they write of the Load-ſtone, it is nothing. Now ſee what I write, and weigh my writings with their writings in even ſcales: If I had not been a guide to my ſelf in getting expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, I ſhould have continued blind and without any knowledg in Phyſick, for all that I can have out of theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Writers. And therefore I am not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170174:49"/> to be blamed, if I leave them, ſeeing I ſeek after greater ſecrets then they did. Experience hath taught me this, that I ſhould follow it, and not them.</p>
                  <p>I intreat the Reader to bear with this diſcourſe, which (I confeſſe) is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the ſubject in hand, viz. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Load-ſtone. But I have thought good to premiſe this admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The antient Writers do tel us, that the Loadſtone draws iron to it, &amp;c. This is indeed true, and it needs no Writer, when every fool knows it. Now I ask, if it be enough to write ſuch things as every clown ſeeth; or if it be not better to add that which the clown ſeeth not. Indeed I think it is lawfull and fitting that I do ſo: for a ſleepy, ſluggiſh foot is not to tread in this path. That is a ſhamefull Philoſophie that hath nothing in it but what is known already by every clown. But I ſpeak by experience (the Miſtreſſe of true knowledg) and according to that knowledg which I have by experience, I affirm, not onely that the Loadſtone is a ſtone in which there is an attractive power to draw to it iron and ſteel; for this is manifeſt to every one: but I add, That <hi>In the Loadſtone there is an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

But I ſay, that we may know diſeaſes more readily by the planets, then by humours. Nevertheleſſe, they ſtill ſing the ſame ſong concerning hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
                  <p>Experience teacheth, that the Load-ſtone drawes all materiall diſeaſes out of their own places to it, with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which are joyned to thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Now it muſt be explained, what thoſe materiall diſeaſes are. Thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes (I ſay) are material diſeaſes, which the Loadſtone draws to it, as it draws iron or ſteel: and of this kind are theſe diſeaſes following, <hi>viz.</hi> the fluxes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as Whites, or extraordinary flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the monthly Courſes &amp;c. all fluxes of the belly; and every other diſeaſe which runs out of its center into a circle, may be brought back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its center, <hi>viz.</hi> by the the Loadſtone. And all the ſeverall ſtreams of Fluxes, which come from the ſame root or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, may be brought back again to their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170174:51"/> fountain by the Loadſtone. Now theſe are the vertues which I ſay are in the Loadſtone, not regarding the tales of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writers, whether they be ancient or modern.</p>
                  <p>But to keep cloſe to the matter in hand, I will ſhew you now where the Loadſtone ſhould be laid; and my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to you is this; that you lay the Load-ſtone upon the center or root of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, where the diſeaſe hath had its firſt being: As for example, if the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the monthly courſes or the whites trouble a woman, then the Loadſtone ſhould be laid upon the root of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, where the ſtrength of the diſeaſe lurks, and whence the diſeaſe had its beginning: and then the diſeaſe ſhall ceaſe. If any flux of the belly trouble you, then lay the Loadſtone upon the place where the root of this flux lurketh, ſo it ſhall be ſtop'd; and ſo likewiſe in other diſeaſes, which from their root have ſpread themſelves through the whole body. Now if the Loadſtone be laid upon their root, then by its vertue the diſeaſe ſhall be brought back to its root again, and ſhall ſtay there. By the ſame vertue of the Loadſtone all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170174:52"/> and ſuperfluities in the body are reſtrained and kept within their own place, whence they may eaſily be driven out by a fit medicine through their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural paſſages, being thereto furthered by a good digeſtion; but this ſtopping of a flux doth not take away the diſeaſe wholly: the only advantage of it is this, that excrements and ſuperfluities are more perfectly digeſted in the place of their root, and more ripened for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation. Thus if you uſe the Load-ſtone for the Collick, you ſhall prevent the Cramp, which is oft-times cauſed by the Collick. For that matter which is the cauſe of the diſeaſe, is confined to the place of its root whence it is evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and where it is fully ripened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Natures method; by which ſeaſonable maturation and evacuation both the Collick and the Cramp are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with it.</p>
                  <p>To give you much in few words, which you ſhall eſteem of as a moſt precious Treaſure, it is this: <hi>Shut up the Diſeaſe within its center or root, that it go not out thence, afterward digeſt it, and ripen it there.</hi> Now how you may ſhut up the diſeaſe within its root, you have heard
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170174:52"/> before, that it is done by the Load-ſtone; but it is to be ripened by other Medicines: Thus the diſeaſe, whether it be good or bad, is cured according to the courſe of Nature. It is a ſhame for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to endeavour to drive out d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as fluxes &amp;c. before they be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripened. Thereby they ſhew their ignorance, that they know not how to ſtay diſeaſes in their own places, and there to ripen them, and thence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them when they are ripe. Indeed, ſuch is the ignorance of the moſt part of Phyſicians, that they can neither do the one nor the other: all their skil is, to cure in one part, and to kill in another.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner the Hydropſie may be ſtayd within its Center, there to be digeſted, and thence expell'd. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are ſeverall wayes of curing the Hydropſie; one is by the Load-ſtone; another is according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Hydropſie &amp;c. So that it holds true, that there may be ſeverall medicines for one diſeaſe. Let us then obſerve what Nature can do, and how it doth it; and that not only in inward diſeaſes, but alſo in outward diſeaſes, which belong to the Surgeon; as the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170174:53"/> Rupture, and the falling down of the fundament: So by the ſame, old run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſores are brought back to their root, and afterward may be purged out by the right paſſages, being ripe, and not crude and unprepared. Then a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians main work is this, to bring a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe into its center; and afterwards to uſe thoſe Medicines which can do that which ought to be done; that is, to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the diſeaſe, and then to expell it.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> In this Chapter you have the vertues of the Load-ſtone more particularly for ſeveral diſeaſes.</head>
                  <p>NOw, that you may rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the uſe of the Loadſtone, you muſt know that in the Loadſtone there is a belly and a back; by the one it drawes things to it; by the other it drives things from it. And firſt, to ſpeak of the Fluxes of women, how they are to be ſtopped and ſtayed in their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170174:53"/> center. The way is thus:</p>
                  <p>The back of the Load-ſtone muſt be placed towards the end of the line, &amp; the belly of it towards the beginning of the line; both parts being ſo placed, that their concavities may be right over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another. And this is to be done not onely for the overflowing of monthly Courſes, and for the Whites; but alſo for all kindes of Fluxes of the belly, however they come. Now the Flux being thus ſhut up in its center or root whence it floweth, then you muſt uſe medicines which will open the Flux. In caſe of a weak ſtomack which cannot digeſt any thing, but ſends down the meat indigeſted and crude; if you can but bring the ſtomack to keep the meat till it come to a right digeſtion, then there will follow a naturall evacuation. Here obſerve, that that which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cannot be reſtrained, but muſt have its courſe: only that which is unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall may be ſtop'd and kept in its place till it becometh naturall. And as it hath been ſaid of the belly, ſo may we do in the diſeaſes of the Mother; and ſo all may be brought to a perfection of their natural digeſtion, and then to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170174:54"/> naturall courſe of evacuation.</p>
                  <p>Mark this addition for the ſtomack, guts, and mother: To bring them to their right digeſtion, you muſt uſe fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which are not to be mentioned here: I have done it elſewhere abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe for fits of the Mother; the Mother muſt be pull'd downward from that place to which it moves by the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Loadſtone, which muſt be downwards, and the back of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone muſt be laid upwards; and this will make the Mother to ſtay in the place of its root, that it ſhalnot move upwards. Afterwards we muſt uſe other medicines proper to the Mother, as the Pearl of Corals and <hi>Mica nigra:</hi> ſo the fits do ceaſe, and the cure is perfected.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for the Falling-ſickneſſe in all the kinds of it; you muſt conſider whence it ariſeth, where it hath its firſt movings, as it alwaies moves upward to the top of the head; therefore you muſt carry the Load-ſtone about you in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, viz. with the belly of it downwards, and the back of it upwards; and that not onely in one place, but alſo for the four quarters of the body; there muſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170174:54"/> be a Loadſtone laid in every quarter: So the diſeaſe ſhall be drawn from the head to its center. But you muſt uſe <hi>Triagummatum</hi> — outwardly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtrengthen the heart; and you muſt take inwardly <hi>Eſſe eſſentiſicatum,</hi> and other Cordials.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner the Cramp is cured: for when you have returned it to its root, then you muſt annoint the part diſeaſed with the oyl of Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient Phyſicians with their companions, have vainly ſpoken much concerning the way of turning theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions which fall down into the eyes, ears, mouth, noſe, and other externall parts of the body, making way to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Fiſtulaes, Ulcers, &amp;c. but all their counſels and inſtructions in that buſineſſe are nothing worth; for they could never find out the true ground of this myſtery, of returning diſeaſes to their root, where they have their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſo they truſted the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of Curing Diſeaſes to their Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Purgations. But this Load-ſtone is the chiefeſt of all Medicines for Turning of defluxions, returning them to their fountains. If firſt the back of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170174:55"/> the Loadſtone, and then the belly of it to be laid towards the root of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, accordingly as the place will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit where the Loadſtone is to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then every defluxion, whereſoever it is in any paſſage to get out of the body, ſhall return back again to its firſt fountain or root; and when it is in its fountain, then it is to be rectified, digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ripened there; and after it is ſo ripened, to be driven out thence. You erroneous Phyſicians, conſider what you do when you would turn defluxions yet crude and not ripened; whereas no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion can be turned to any other place, till firſt it be turned back to the place of its nativity; <hi>i. e.</hi> the root or fountain where it had its beginning, and be ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. Now conſider how you can do this. What? can you do it by purging? That is impoſſible; for you do no more by purging but drive out the diſeaſe crude, and not yet ripe, through the guts, and thereby you multiply diſeaſes. But the right way is this; to bring back the defluxion to the fountain, and to keep it there till it be ripened; then let nature caſt it out afterwards. Now the defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be ripened by <hi>Eſſe eſſentificatum</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170174:55"/> made of the ſtands of Wine, in that way of preparation which is diſcovered to us by the light of experience. Thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are cured ulcerous Legs, Cancers, Fiſtulaes and the like: but we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> in whatſoever place of the body it is.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the nature of the Larch-tree, or Turpentine tree, to delight in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous ground, and ſuch ground which is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured. As there are Beaſts, ſome wilde, and ſome tame; ſo Trees, ſome grow wild, ſome are planted. The Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine-tree
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170174:57"/> planted in domeſtick places, differs no otherwiſe from that which groweth wild, then a Doe brought from the mountains differs from that which is kept in a garden; but the Turpentine it ſelf hath great harm by this tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for when it is taken from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive place, viz. which is moſt agreeable to it, then is it removed from its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nouriſhment, whereby it is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and hath its being. And as manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ground is eaſily known by ſight from that which is not manured: ſo may the domeſtick Turpentine be known from that which is wild: for the wild Turpentine grows not in good ground, but the domeſtick growes in good ground; and when it is brought from mountainous places and planted in plain ground, then is it deprived of that high air which is upon the mountains, and muſt now ſtand in a different air, viz. the air of low grounds, which is very much contrary to its nature.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo other reaſons why the Larch-tree ſhould not be tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But the chief reaſon is this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that celeſtiall influence which is in the Turpentine from the Starres,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170174:57"/> comes down to the mountains, but not to the low grounds; and if the Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine do not enjoy this influence daily, then it cannot come to the perfection of a Balſom: but this influence cannot be tranſplanted, it cannot be brought to the low grounds from the mountains, where it uſeth to be.</p>
                  <p>I would have all obſerve this, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially Phyſicians, That every thing which groweth ſhould be taken in the place of its influence, where it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth naturally of it ſelf. Its true, that in the tranſplanted Turpentine are all the ſame kindes of Vertues which are in the other true Turpentine; but weaker and more imperfect: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; Common people ſay, that the fiſh called the <hi>Wolf</hi> doth thrive better in one water then in another: and the beſt fiſhes, if they be put into ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they will become worſe, and they will have the taſte of thoſe waters: and thoſe fiſhes which live in ſmooth waters differ much from the ſame kinde of fiſh which lives in rough waters: And as there is difference of waters; ſo there is alſo difference of grounds; and ſo there muſt be alſo a difference
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170174:58"/> in plants growing in divers grounds. We muſt remember this, that the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine hath its old age, and the older it is, ſo much the weaker it is: its firſt age is ſixty years, its middle age is from ſixty years to one hundred and eighty; then begins its old age. When it grows old, it becomes incapable to receive the celeſtiall influence; for ſpiritual impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions cannot be well received into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed bodies. And what I have now ſpoken of the Larch-tree, the ſame is to be underſtood of all other Trees or Herbs of the like nature; viz. which have ſome ſpeciall influence from the Stars. I do not ſpeak of that only which is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen; but I ſpeak of that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the life and ſoul of the herb, which preſerves the herb, dwelling in thoſe Vertues which ſtream from it into the corporeal parts of the herb.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken here the more plainly, that you may underſtand that vertue by which every diſeaſe is cured.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That the right Turpentine is equall to the Indian Balſom in its preſerving Vertue: and how it hath this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by the influence of the Stars, and by the Elements, is fully explained.</head>
                  <p>ANd truly, if we ought to write of the Vertues of any Tree then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the Larch-tree, rather then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. For it hath a true Balſome, which is to be eſteemed of as a Balſome; being of the ſame nature and goodneſſe with the beyond-ſea Indian Balſom For albeit the Indian Balſom, as it is a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, hath ſome other properties which the Turpentine hath not: yet the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Larch-tree hath not onely the nature of a Balſom, but it hath alſo ſome other vertues. Now a Balſom is that which preſerves bodies from putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as is evident by theſe two Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms. And concerning this German Balſom, or Balſom of the Larch-tree,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170174:59"/> know this, that bodies prepared and embalmed with it, never putrifie, if it hath been taken from the tree in its time when it ſhould be: for the celeſtial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from which it hath this balſome Vertue, requires that it ſhould be taken in the right time.</p>
                  <p>Many Sepulchers of the Ethnicks, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the Romans; have been found and opened, where dead bodies lay embalmed in Alabaſter and Marble cheſts: the balſome wherewith they were embalmed, was thought to be the Indian Balſome: but this was a miſtake, for after it was tryed by ſome who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched into the nature of it, it was found to be Turpentine. So that this Turpentine may have two names; it ſhould be called Balſom (and not Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine) if it be ſo gathered, and in ſuch a time as the Balſome influence of the Stars requireth; viz. when the Moon is in the Balſome ſignes; and if it be not then gathered, it is not a Balſome, but it ſhould be called Turpentine. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, That every thing which groweth, as trees herbs, &amp;c. they have naturally a kinde of Balſome in them: for if the tree be cut down when the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170174:59"/> Moon is in the Balſome-ſignes, it will not have either clefts or worms in it: for its Balſome nature is fully ſetled in it by its agreement with the celeſtiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: and how much a Balſome is encreaſed in vertue, ſo much it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
                  <p>But that you may not neglect the right time of gathering the Turpentine, or this German Balſom from the tree, conſider this example: they who keep milch beaſts muſt not neglect the time of milking: for that time is by Natures own appointment; and if you do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, then the milk may curdle in the beaſts udder, afterwards diſſolve, grow ſowriſh, and ſo grow more and more corrupt, whereupon diſeaſes follow. The like doth alſo befall man: for if a man be hindered when hee would go to ſtool, or when he would evacuate urine, &amp;c. then follow diſeaſes, as the Strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Dyſury, the inſatiable deſire of going to ſtool, called Tenaſm. Now by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples you may ſee, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time and hour when the Turpentine ſhould be gathered from the tree; viz. if it be gathered in the time of a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-influence, then it is a Balſom: but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170174:60"/> if it be gathered in any other time, then it is not a Balſom, but only a Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; for that time when it is taken from the tree, is the time of his generation, which makes it to be a Balſom or a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine: and therefore this time ought to be much obſerved; it is in our power to chuſe it.</p>
                  <p>By this you ſee how much it concerns every Phyſician to know the motions of the heavens, to have the knowledg of Aſtronomie. If the Turpentine be left too long in the tree, then it is neither a Balſom nor a Turpentine; for it loſeth its vertue, and changeth its nature, and there is no goodneſſe in it: and if it be gathered from the tree too ſoon, before it be fully ripe, and it hath all that vertue which it ſhould have, it cauſeth the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Dyſurie, inſatiable deſire of going to ſtool &amp;c. and many other Diſeaſes, through the unskilfulneſſe of Doctors and Apothecaries. Theſe things I ſhew you for this end, that you may know how to proceed more exactly and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly to diſcover and bring out thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertues and myſteries which lurk in the Turpentine.</p>
                  <p>To proceed concerning the Vertues
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170174:60"/> of the Turpentine, whence they come:</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you, that thoſe things which I write here, do not agree with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther books and other Writers: But why do they thus differ from me? The cauſe of it is their imprudency and ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in thoſe things which every one ſhould know.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, it hath its Vertue from the Elements: the ſeed of it, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the earth becomes a tree, and into that tree is this vertue infuſed, which is for the good and benefit of man.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider what brings the liquor of this tree to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, viz. of a Balſom. The firſt cauſe which brings the Turpentine to be of a Balſom nature, it is the heavenly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: even as Gold and Silver being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the droſs, are a pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
                  <p>If you would know why I do ſo much eſteem of the hour of the birth, that is, that hour when any thing comes firſt out of the place where it had its firſt being; The reaſon why I ſo much regard this hour, is this; becauſe when any thing is born, it hath in it ſelf the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170174:61"/> of the whole world; ſo that it hath that which is impure, as well as that which is pure; it hath that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as well as that which is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; evill as well as good; that which is fit and uſefull, and that which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and unuſefull: and when any thing comes into the world, then it goes through a furnace, an inviſible fire, and this fire is the Firmament: and as this fire is, ſo is the thing born more or leſſe purged from that which is evill in it, or uſeleſſe, or impure, &amp;c. And how much more it hath of Starry-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences concurring in it, it becomes ſo much the more pure, good, beautifull, &amp;c. And this that I now ſpeak is not onely to be underſtood of Turpentine, but alſo of every thing naturall: in this manner Turpentine is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Balſome by theſe heavenly Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It hath its temperature from the Elements, viz. the Aire, of whoſe nature and property it is: which you muſt underſtand thus: The Air pierceth through all other Elements, and all bodies which are made of the Elements. Every thing with all its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170174:61"/> is made up of thoſe four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and whatſoever proceeds of the Air, it hath an aeriall nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be hot and moiſt. As for thoſe degrees, <hi>firſt, ſecond, third, fourth,</hi> which have been invented by ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians deluded with their own vain i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations: Eſteem of them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that they are groundleſſe and fooliſh; for there is onely one degree, not more nor fewer: in the Snow there is but one degree of coldneſſe; in the Fire one degree of heat. Howbeit, in Alchimie there be degrees of heat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: yet that which we chiefly look upon, is the eſſence it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Turpentine hath a medicinal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which God hath created in it: for Medicine (or medicinal vertue) in natural things, is an inviſible ſpirit infuſed into their bodies, as the ſpirit of man was breathed into man. In Turpentine there are five things to be conſidered; viz An Elementary body, The heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſions of the Starrs, The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Vulcan,</hi> The complexion of the Chaos, and a created Spirit: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe five things, I will ſhew you five ſeverall kindes of Vertues in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170174:62"/> Turpentine. That you may the better underſtand the power and vertues of it ſeverally, according to their natures; and that you may lay your ground-work in Phyſick by Aſtronomie and Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; ſo your experience ſhall be daily more increaſed, and appear more in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The vertues of Turpentine.</head>
                  <p>ANd ſeeing the Turpentine (as I have before told you) is changed into a Balſom; therefore I will now ſhew you the Balſom-vertues of it, which are not inferiour to the Indian Balſome, as it ſhall appear.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, to ſpeak of the Imbalming of dead bodies. Embalming may be underſtood two wayes; either when dead bodies are embalmed under Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Conſtellations; that is, when the Moon is in Balſom ſignes: There be 12 hours of the day in which the ſpirits of the firmament in their motion paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170174:62"/> us, and this muſt be daily. Again, obſerve, That the ſecret of Embalming conſiſteth much in the removing of the excrements at the laſt breath of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deceaſed; this will make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of the body to continue longeſt without decay: But whether of theſe wayes be uſed, thereby the body may be kept without putrifaction.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſpoken concerning the conſervation of dead bodies, it is to ſhew you the excellency of Balſom; and that the influence of the Starrs may have its operation in us who are alive, as well as in dead bodies; yea, the ſtrength and vertues of it appear more in the living, then in the dead.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas many great diſeaſes (as none will deny) may be cauſed by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or poyſon in the bodies of men; nay there is not any diſeaſe but it may be cauſed by poiſon; for that part of the body which hath not any diſpoſition to putrifaction, wil not yeild to poiſon; and that which is moſt powerfull againſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, is the beſt medicine againſt diſeaſes. Hence it follows, that as Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom is from the Stars, ſo alſo is the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence: therefore if you join like to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170174:63"/> like, that is, if you give Balſom to them who are in danger to be infected with the peſtilence, the Balſome will keep out the Peſtilence: as they who are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Gariſon, can eaſily keep out the enemy; ſo Balſome keeps out the Peſtilence; that where Balſom is, there the Peſtilence which comes from the Starrs, can do no hurt. But if the Peſtilence hath already got into the body, then the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom can do no good. So that the method to be obſerved in uſing this Balſom, is this: The Phyſician ſhould be carefull to give this Balſom before the infection or the diſeaſe be in the body, and this will keep the body that it ſhall not be infected by poyſon or any diſeaſe. This a Phyſician ſhould know, and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an unfitting thing, that a Phyſician newly come from the Univerſities ſhould be ignorant of this, and now muſt learn it of me.</p>
                  <p>Balſome doth alſo preſerve us from Feavers and all Apoſtems, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward, if it be uſed before the Apoſteme breaketh out. So that the chief uſe of this Balſom is to preſerve from diſeaſes, and not to cure diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>This Balſome is alſo an enemy to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170174:63"/> Worms; for where Balſome is, there cannot be any worms or Beetle-flies, &amp;c. or any other vermine, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the off-ſpring of excrements.</p>
                  <p>I cannot reckon all the Diſeaſes which come of putrid cauſes, or putrifactions: but whatſoever they are, you may uſe the ſame method for them all. Doctors, I only tell you of this; and I hope you have learned ſo much in the Univerſities, that you have a full knowledg of every thing. And truly I think, that medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall experience could not do you any harm. But I diſſent from you, becauſe you diſſent from me.</p>
                  <p>Remember this, which I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that when any thing is in its birth, <hi>i. e.</hi> when it firſt leaves the place where it was formed, then that which is pure in it, is ſeparated from that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, by the influence of the Stars. Now in the Turpentine there are ſome impure mixtures which come from the impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn;</hi> and theſe do very much hinder the good Vertues of Turpentine, which comes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the good Stars. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Stars, like a lightning, conſumeth theſe impurities in the birth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170174:64"/> of the Turpentine: and when it is thus purified, then the two laſt vertues of it appear; viz. that which is from the Air, and that which is from the infuſed ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the air, learn this, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy teacheth you; that as is the naturall generation of the Air, ſo is the alteration of the Air, when it is at any time changed. You who are Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſhould know the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Air, and ſo you may better know how to preſerve from thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which come by the infection of the Air. Its better to prevent the violence of the heaven, then to delay till it comes, its eaſier keeping it out, then driving it out.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Preparations of Turpentine.</head>
                  <p>ONe way of Preparing Turpentine is thus: Boyle it in ſtrong red wine; and before the wine be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, powr upon it the water of ſow-bread,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170174:64"/> —and with it waſh the Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine when it is cooled; and thereafter keep it in a cloſe place. Saturnine wounds are cured by it, if it be dropt into them; and afterwards lay a Wound-plaiſter to them; or bind them up ſo as Wounds ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>And if you put to the Turpentine half as much of the whites of eggs, it will be a great deal better for the wound; but if ſuperfluous fleſh be bred in the wound, then to the aforeſaid plaiſter you muſt add burn'd allom prepared with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo the rank fleſh ſhall be conſumed without any pain to the patient: But ſuch things you muſt learn by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Every one who hath wine in his hand cannot drink it decently.</p>
                  <p>There are other things which may be added to the Turpentine, but I will now paſſe them over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alchimie,</hi> which brings the vertues of things to the light, and to be of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull efficacy; it hath alſo taken Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine in hand for the good of man, and hath diſtilled it; and being diſtilled, it was afterwards taken notice of by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Now thoſe who are unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Phyſick, do think that this worthy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170174:65"/> medicine was found out by thoſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks, only learned in their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who, ever ſince the beginning of the world, have been contemners of all good Arts, ſpending all their time in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions; they car'd for no more, but to ſatisfy their eies: they never ſearch'd into the nature of this Turpentine, neither had they ever any experience of it; but they let their patients die, when they might eaſily have been reſtored to health.</p>
                  <p>But in this our age experience hath taught me, that diſtil'd Turpentine is an excellent medicine for any unnatural hardneſſe in the body to take it away; but obſerve, that there are ſeveral kinds of hardneſſes in the body, <hi>viz.</hi> the hardneſſe of the ſpleen, the hardneſſe of the liver, and the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of other inward parts: as elſe the hardneſſe of outward parts, as kernels, hardned ſkin &amp;c. Briefly, whatſoever unnaturall thing is in the body, which is of the nature of haire, or of a veine, or of a bone, or of a griſtle, it is taken away by this diſtil'd Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, adding to it ſuch other medicines which are proper to ſuch diſeaſes, and obſerving their quantities when you
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170174:65"/> mix them. As for the knotty Gout, take this diſtil'd Turpentine with the eſſence of Mummy.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken concerning this Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine balſome, ſo much as is known to me by experience. I will therefore now make an end of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, hoping that theſe experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Turpentine diſcovered by me, ſhall be found by others to be true, to their great comfort. But I muſt not forget to tell you of one thing, that if this deſtill'd Turpentine be drop'd into the wounds of veins, it preſerves the veins from all inconveniencies. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s diſtill'd Turpentine likewiſe aſſwageth the pains of the Gout.</p>
                  <p>If Turpentine be a little time ſet over the fire, when it is cold it becomes hard like glaſs; take this glaſſe, and diſſolve it with Amber; and diſtill it in the right way, and it will be a moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and excellent Varniſh; if you lay it upon any thing, and dry it ſpeedily; if you mix the powder of tiles with this glaſs over the fire, you may therewith make moſt firm and cloſs floors, where you may keep a great quantity of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver without decay &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170174:66"/>
                  <p>I will now ſhew you the way how the Balſome is to be ſeparated from the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine.</p>
                  <p>When you have gathered the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine from the tree in the right time; <hi>i. e.</hi> in the time of the Balſome influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as it hath been before declared: the ſame hour when it is taken from the tree, you muſt put it in your veſſell, which muſt ſtand in warm dung, one half of the veſſell being within the dung; fill your veſſell with Turpentine, and ſo let it ſtand in the dung ſome time, and there it will purge out its impurities. When its purified enough, you will find that it hath divided it ſelf into two parts: the upper part of it will be clear, but that which is under is not ſo clear: pour it out as it is heated by the heat of the dung, into another veſſel, which is already placed in the firſt degree of heat. Here you muſt take notice, that this firſt degree of heat, is the firſt of thoſe twelve degrees which are in heat: and in this firſt degree of heat it muſt ſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſixty hours, and digeſt: and here it will divide it ſelf again into two parts; the upper part will be very clear and perſpicuous; this is the Balſom, ſo much
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170174:66"/> of it as is thus clear: but the under part, which is not ſo clear, is the pure Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. Theſe two, viz. the Turpentine and the Balſome are ſeparated the one from the other, as the iron from ſteel. In this Balſom lurks many admirable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, more then I can finde out in my life time: but doubtleſſe, the reſt of its Vertues may be found out by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if Phyſicians were as deſirous and carefull how to cure diſeaſes, as they are to fill their purſes; or if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Magiſtrate to be ſuch as they profeſſe themſelves to be. Now if every Tradeſ-man ought to have skill and experience in that Trade which he profeſſeth, much more ought the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to have great skill and experience in ſo weighty a buſineſs as the health and life of man.</p>

                  <p>WEE have three ſorts of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines out of Ebony, <hi>viz.</hi> a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, a Gum, and a Salt; the liquor is like the juice of Sloes: the Gumme is like that balſome which is got from the Larch-tree: the Salt is like that Salt which the Apothecaries call <hi>ſal gemmae:</hi> the liquor is the portion: the Gum is the unguent: the ſalt is the purgative which purgeth and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                  <p>The liquor muſt be extracted out of the wood, by cloſe diſtillation, as the oyl of Nutmeg is extracted out of the Nutmeg: one pound and a half of this liquor is more efficacious then an hundred pound of that liquor in which the wood only hath been boiled.</p>
                  <p>When we have got out the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, then we muſt extract the Gumme out of the wood, thus; put the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170174:67"/> Ebony-wood in a cloſe reverbatory, in the ſecond degree of fire, the ſpace of twenty four hours, then you ſhall ſee the Gumme come out clammy, and ſticking to your fingers like liquid Styrax of a ſavory, delightſome ſavour, one pound and ſix ounces of this Gumme is better, and more efficacious then two hundred pound weight of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in which the wood only is boyl'd. Laſtly, the Salt of it is made thus; you muſt burn the wood to aſhes, (for aſhes is the mine of ſalt) then pour the water of Fumitory upon theſe aſhes, and this will bring the ſalt out of the aſhes; then congeale the ſalt according to the uſual way, and you ſhall have a ſalt almoſt like theſe ſalts, called <hi>Salt Entalls,</hi> or Salt <hi>Anatron:</hi> one pound and five drams of this Salt is better then fifty pound weight of that liquor which is made after the common way, which is only the boyling the wood in water, or ſome other liquor.</p>
                  <p>With this Salt you may make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purge, thus; take of this Salt a half ſcruple, of <hi>Alexandrine</hi> Treacle two drams, mix them together: of this give at a time the quantity of a halfe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170174:68"/> ſcruple; and this is to be given not only once or twice, but three or four times, or oftner, as the diſeaſe requires. There is ſuch a vertue in this ſalt to purge the Gout, the Palſie, and thoſe humours which are breaking out, as no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine whatſoever, whether it be purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or laxative or expulſive: For this Salt is to ſuch diſeaſes as fire to water. If you would uſe this Salt in any Cure to be done by Chirurgery, you muſt proceed thus: If the ſore be open, you muſt firſt cleanſe it by the Salt; then you muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it with the gumm twice every day, till the cure be perfected, and the ſore place well skinned.</p>
                  <p>If there be a great pain in any part of the body, and there is nothing to be ſeen, then annoint the place with this gumm.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I never purpoſed to write concerning, theſe nor have I ever ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of them in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books: yet I think it profitable and neceſſary, that I ſhould make a new plantation, not onely of Phyſick, but alſo of other Sciences and Secrets of Nature, which are buried in forgetfulneſſe, and by the ignorant are contemned and evill ſpoken of: which certainly is a puniſhment from God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170174:71"/> us; becauſe wee will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the great myſteries and gifts of God to be divine, therefore God is angry with us, and is provoked to take from us again thoſe gifts and ſecrets, and to give them to others who will receive them with greater thankfulneſſe, and not ſlight them as we do.</p>
                  <p>I will firſt treat of Serpents, and ſhew you the benefits which we may have by the ſeveral parts of the Serpent; and firſt of the Tongue of it, which hath a wonderful power; and many do carry it about them as a holy thing to defend them againſt weapons, and all enemies preſent or abſent: this alſo hath made many victorious and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, not only in battails and duels, but alſo in other buſineſs: by this lovers have gained the affections of them whom they loved; which I do not ſpeak of that we ſhould do the like; but that we may know how great the power and operations of nature are; yet it cannot be denied but that our imagination and believing may much encreaſe or diminiſh the power of ſuch things accordingly, as they are uſed.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:170174:71"/>
                  <p>Some who have been troubled with, an inward impoſthume near the heart have laid the tongue of the Adder or Serpent upon their breſt, over againſt their heart, which hath ſo powerfully drawn out the poiſon of the impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume, that it hath ſtuck upon their breſt in drops; then theſe drops being wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away, and the Adders tongue again laid upon the place, which was done thus ſo often until there appeared no more drops upon their breaſt, and ſo the patient was cured. The ſame uſe may be made of Toads, as I have ſhewed in ſome other of my writings: thruſt a ſtick through the head of the Toad, and ſet the ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the ground, that the Toad may dry upon the top of the ſtick, when it is well dried, then wrap it in a linnen cloth, lay it ſo upon the impoſthume or part diſeaſed, there leave it til it hath drawn out all the poyſon; or if you will, you may apply the Toad to the place without a cloth about it, and it hath the ſame effect. And as the patient and the diſeaſe requires: ſo the Toad muſt be the oftner applied till the Toad ſwells no more: for when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170174:72"/> it ſwels no more, it is a ſigne that all the poyſon is drawn out, and that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is recovering. Howbeit, this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrikes a terrour into every one who ſees it neer them; even by their look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, they are ſtricken with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: yet it is not therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; but it is to be eſteemed of, and to be uſed as a great Secret of Nature. I could wiſh that this Remedy were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred more, then it hath been hitherto, to all other attractive, maturative, or corroſive Medicines.</p>

                  <p>THere be many other effects of the Adders tongue then thoſe already mentioned, which would be tedious to rehearſe: But where I treat of Magick Cures, there I ſpeak largely, not only of this, but alſo of many other excellent natural Vertues, and naturall Things.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who lived in former times, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about them many Sigils, which did
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170174:72"/> wonderfull things; for by them they could cure ſuch difficult diſeaſes, for which we cannot readily find any remedy in the earth: and only by carrying theſe Sigils about them, they did partake of their Vertues, whereby they were ſafe, and without danger of harm by weapons or enemies: thereby they alſo became very proſperous, and had great victories: and many other ſtrange effects have been done by theſe Sigils, of which we will not ſpeak now.</p>
                  <p>There have been found words writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and Characters, and Sigils, and ſtrange Images delineated upon Vergin-paper, or cut in Metals, or in Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen's, or in precious Stones, as Saphires, &amp;c. with ſtrange ſhapes; in ſome the ſhape of a man, in ſome the ſhape of a beaſt: And ſuch were the unſpeakable vertues of thoſe Characters, Sigils, &amp;c. that they ſeemed to go beyond all the bounds of Nature it ſelf: and ſo <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus, Hermogenes, Balenius, Virgilius, Albertus Magnus</hi> have declared: But the books of theſe Authors are fouly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with thoſe ſuperſtitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are in them: ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſafely truſt to every thing in thoſe

And now there are no writings better and larger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſupernaturall Science, then thoſe which <hi>Techellus</hi> the Jew hath left to us: there is but little of his writing now remaining; and theſe of his writings which are extant, they are contemn'd, becauſe he was a Jew,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170174:73"/> a famous maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a moſt ſubtle ſearcher of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But now I return to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe concerning the Serpent or Adder: the skin of the Adder hath a ſingular faculty in curing wounds: if you make a powder of this skin, and ſtrow it upon the wound. Some, when they go to fight bind this skin about that arm which holds the ſword or other weapon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they fight, and ſo they fight happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and get the victory.</p>
                  <p>If a woman with child, or in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth bind this skin about her neck, or about her body, ſhe thereby becomes victorious in this duel of nature, ſhe happily goes through with the buſineſs of child-birth.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt remember this, that it is not every skin of the Serpent or Adder hath ſuch a power, but only that skin which the adder caſts. The ſame is to be underſtood of the Adders tongue; it is not every tongue that hath ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but only that which is pluck'd out of the Adder alive.</p>

                  <p>BUt that I may haſten to make an end of this ſubject; know this, That in the fat and fleſh of a Serpent there is a ſingular faculty of healing both new wounds, and all venemous bitings, and evill ulcers. The fleſh of the Adder hath the like vertues, yea more; it hath in it a ſingular ſecret, and great medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal vertues, if you cut off the head and tail, and let the blood run out, in which is all the poyſon. But in this place I will be brief concerning theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſpoken of them largely elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>Now I will ſpeak ſomething of thoſe who do conſecrate Serpents: this is a thing which they do not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and in this they are contrary to the wayes of God and Nature. And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170174:74"/> although by theſe conſecrations Serpents are tamed and made tractable; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſuch doings are not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, as conſecrations and other ſuperſtitions, whereby people are made ſick or well. For if according to the courſe of nature we may do ſuch things by the power of a ſtrong faith, and by the ſtrength of imagination; then why ſhould we uſe theſe ſuperſtitious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? Yet it cannot be denyed, but that there be ſome words, which if they be pronounced againſt Serpents, it makes them tractable and obedient.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo ſome Preſervatives, which (if uſed) will keep us from the hurt of any venemous creature. But we need not much fear this kind of Serpent of which we ſpeak in this Treatiſe, which is by nature leſſe hurtfull then any other kind of Serpent: But we muſt be very cautious of ſtarry Serpents which are ſpeckled over with Stars, Sirens, Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, Salamanders, Baſilisks, which be all ſeverall kinds of Serpents, moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous and great enemies to man: their venome is exceeding ſtrong and violent. Albeit there be few of theſe kindes of Serpents in <hi>Germany,</hi> yet I ſpeak of them,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170174:75"/> that people ſhould be warie of them where they are.</p>
                  <p>I know not any preſervative better, and more certain againſt the poiſon of theſe Serpents, then Camphore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Rock-oyl, otherwiſe call'd oyl <hi>Petreole,</hi> wherewith you muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint your hands, and your feet, and other naked places of your body, and ſo thou mayeſt ſafely handle them: but becauſe this preſervative can do no good, or is not efficacious enough againſt the moſt fierce and moſt poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Serpents; as that kind of Serpent which leaps at a man being a great way off: and the Crocodile which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours a whole man, albeit he be dead: and the Baſilisk which kills a man by its ſight only: therefore thoſe who dwel in thoſe places where theſe Serpents are, carried about them <hi>Gameheu's,</hi> which were made in the ſhape of a man, with his left foot trampling upon the neck of a Serpent; and they eſteem'd of this as a ſingular preſervative againſt theſe Serpents. Of this and other things, <hi>Techellus</hi> hath written, who hath gone farre beyond all other writers in this kind; but ſome wicked deceivers

                  <p>I conceive it not needful, that I ſhould ſay any more of Serpents now, becauſe I will treat of them largely, and diſcover many more wonderful things of them in that book which I will write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sacraments, and things won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerful.</p>

                  <p>THere lurks many great Secrets, not only in the Serpent, but alſo in other abominable creatures, which ſtrike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into a man, even with the ſight of them; as the Toad, of which I have ſpoken before, it is a great help againſt the plague, and the bitings of venemous creatures, if, after it is well dried
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170174:76"/> it be applied outwardly to the part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; it ſpeedily draweth poyſon out of the body; it hath preſerved the life of thoſe who have deſpaired of help by any other remedies. I have ſeen the Morphew cured by it throughly and ſpeedily, thus; the Toad muſt be boiled alive in oyl till it dies, and with this oyl annoint the place where this diſeaſe is; this oyl is alſo very good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt evil Ulcers. But falſe phyſicians, when they hear of theſe ſecrets, they cannot be brought to believe that they are true.</p>
                  <p>The Spider is a hateful creature, yet it is of great vertue againſt Quotidian Feavers: put the ſpider in a nut-ſhell, and ſhut it up cloſe in it, and let the diſeaſed perſon carry it about him, but he muſt not know what it is; let him carry it four dayes, and he ſhall be well.</p>
                  <p>The Salamander is uſeleſſe in Phyſick: but the Alchimiſt hath laboured much in it to extract out of it a tincture f r metalls, and thereby to make gold, and for this it is indeed to be much regarded: but you cannot meddle with it without great danger, for the poyſon of it is moſt deadly.</p>

                  <p>HAving done with theſe hateful and poyſonous creatures, now I will ſpeak concerning the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, contemptible ſmall creatures: and I hope I ſhall not be blamed for this, nor ſhall theſe things I ſpeak be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as fained tales, as falſe phyſitians do, who will not uſe any common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, ſuch as may be gotten cheaply, and eaſily, not remembring this, that God hath created nothing in vain, but that even the leaſt and moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things have their peculiar vertues according to his divine pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And it is our fault that we know not theſe things, for we are careleſs and incredulous, and ſoon wearied in the ſearch of nature. Now if any do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the gifts of God in them, and are diligent in ſearching out the works of

                  <p>Now I profeſs my ſelf to be one of thoſe who have found out the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea, and that I am not one of the leaſt of the ſearchers of nature, and truly whatſoever art or experience I have, I ſhould have imparted it freely and plainly to you; but your ambition and inſolency hath made me change my mind, becauſe you will have all the praiſe to your ſelves, and ſteale it from him who is your teacher; therefore you are not worthy of my art, which would be very advantageous to you, if you would become true Phyſicians and lovers of your neighbours. But you preferre the profit of your prrſe, and of your kitchin, to the health of your patients: and in this you are learned indeed, and more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then I. You accuſe mee, and blame mee becauſe I doe not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſe you. It's true, I doe it, not becauſe I find you to be onely
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170174:77"/> purſe phyſicians, ſuch who are more able to cure the diſeaſes of your purſes, then the diſeaſes of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; if it were not ſo, how could you build ſuch ſtately houſes, weare gold rings, walke in your ſilkes? You reproach me becauſe of my poverty and mean clothes: but if I ſhould take (as you do) ſhameleſly ſuch great rewards every where, then I ſhould be richer then any of you: yet as I am, I am richer then any of you; for my riches are ſurer to me, then your riches to you: my skill is my great riches, which neither thiefe can ſteale, nor fire, or water can devoure, nor robber can take from mee. They may take my life, but they cannot get my Art that is hidden in mee, and dieth with mee. You ſee then what an excellent thing I enjoy, which is farre better then your houſes, plantations, clothes, riches, gold, and ſilver, and all your skill. And if at any time I ſpend my mony largely amongſt my pleaſant companions, yet I doe not diminiſh (as the proverb is) the principall ſum, that is, my Art, which through

Truly, I believe that they were ignorant of them; or if they knew them, then they ſlighted them, ſo that theſe things were quite forgotten: the moſt common, and moſt inconſiderable Vermine are Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, which after a ſhowre, creep out of the ground: and who will believe, that in theſe worms is ſo much Vertue for the good of the body of man? they are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially good againſt that diſeaſe and pain which is in the fingers and toes, which cauſeth extreme torment day and night: The Whit flaw, which the Ancients call'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170174:78"/> the gnawing worm, and indeed not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe; for they knew that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe ſhould be cured by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm; the way is this; Take an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm bigger or leſſer according to the patient, and the greatneſſe of the pain, if the patient be not very young, but is of a good age, and the pain very great, then you muſt take a great earth-worm, it muſt be large, that it may be ſufficient for the diſeaſe, wrap this worm in a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth, and ſo lay it upon the part where the pain is, the ſpace of twenty four hours, till it dies, and when it is dead. the diſeaſe is cured, and (as it were) dieth with the worm; theſe things may ſeem to ſome to be ſuperſtitious, and fained tales; but by this it appears, that God hath made nothing in the world ſo baſe, and ſo contemptible, which is not ſome way for the good of man.</p>

                  <p>THE Earth-worm is not only good againſt the foreſaid diſeaſe, but alſo againſt all kinds of worms in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man, if it be dried, and made into a powder, and ſo it is to be taken in ſome liquor; the beſt liquor is the whay of Goats milk: for the powder of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms taken in this whay purgeth by ſtool all worms of the ſtomack, or that ſtick in the guts.</p>
                  <p>The Mouſe, called the field Mouſe, is a great Secret for the ptiſick. And that kind of Crab called the Cancer, hath often cured the diſeaſe called the Canker, viz. thus, bind a linnen cloth about the fiſh Cancer, and about its toes: and lay the toes of this fiſh, Cancer upon the place where the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170174:79"/> Ulcer, Canker is, untill the fiſh-Cancer, be dead: and when it is dead, the ulcer, Canker is alſo kill'd; but if the Canker was broken out into a ſore, then after it is mortified with the fiſh-Cancer, you muſt apply the plaiſter which is uſed for thruſts, or deep wounds.</p>
                  <p>By this fiſh-Cancer have been alſo cured Feavers; and Hydropſies, thus; firſt, you muſt cut off all the nailes of the patients fingers and toes, then you muſt bind the fiſh Cancer to his back, afterward put it into a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and let it goe; and ſo the patient ſhall be cured. Do not you think theſe to be vaine, ſuperſtitious, or Mountebank cures? I aſſure you they are the true operations of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wrought by God himſelf, who was pleaſed to give to creatures in their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch great Vertues.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, that ſome, who have uſed the fiſh Cancer for the foreſaid diſeaſes, have been nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170174:80"/> thought little of this, when they tried this remedy: and when they did ſee, that it did not good to all alike: they then falſly conceived that it was a thing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious; and that only believing did work here; without which they thought the Cancer had no efficacy. It is true, that imagination and believing are ſo powerful, that they can make people well or ſick. But ſuch common remedies as I have ſpoken of, are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. We find in the holy Scriptures that Chriſt and the Prophets cured great diſeaſes by very common and ordinary things. So Chriſt gave ſight to the blind by clay mixed with his ſpittle. So the Prophet cured the plague by a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of figs: but to gather together here all ſuch examples, is not needful, I wil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go on to ſpeak of the Vertues of thoſe things.</p>

                  <p>IN the foreſaid fiſh Cancer have been found many other Vertues; it hath an excellent cooling faculty, and it is good againſt St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, if you preſſe the juice out of the toes of it, and anoint the place with this juice: you may alſo make an oyntment with this juice, very good againſt all ſorts of burnings or ſcaldings, <hi>viz.</hi> by fire, or water, or pitch, or fat things, &amp;c. The Ancients never found a better remedy then this againſt any burnings. This oyntment is alſo good againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, eating ſores; and if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed upon the temples of the head, it very much helpeth thoſe extraordinary pains of the head, which almoſt diſtracts people, It helpeth alſo that inflamation called the Roſe, and the heat of ulcers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170174:81"/> of womens breſts; in ſuch caſes it hath done very much good. The Cancer hath alſo a faculty of expelling urine, ſand, and the ſtone in the bladder. which it doth powerfully diſſolve, and expel with the urine, ſo that thoſe who ſeed much upon theſe Cancers, they are free from thoſe diſeaſes; ſo they are an excellent preſervative.</p>
                  <p>I cannot paſſe by here the cruelty of phyſicians, who would cure the Canker by cutting, burning, and eating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; and they had no other reaſon for it, but that they thought, ſuch a diſeaſe could not be overcome but by corroſives; but ſo they make the pain greater, not conſidering, that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker it ſelf is an eating ſore, and therefore we ſhould uſe ſuch things to it, which wil pacifie it, and allay the pain, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure it; all they can ſay, is this; that one evil ſhould be driven out by another evil. But I ſay, that we ſhould begin the cure of every diſeaſe, with pain aſſwaging Medicines, which can quiet the diſeaſe, and take away the raging of it, allaying thoſe paines which accompany it; as for example a man in a rage cannot be pacified by ſtroaks
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170174:81"/> or wounds; ſo neither can a diſeaſe by exaſperating medicines: and as thoſe, who are ſad and melancholy ſhould have cordials given to them, they ſhould be comforted and refreſhed with mirth; ſo it is in curing any diſeaſe; that which is evil, muſt be cured by that which is good, and not one evil to be cured by another. Then hitherto your phyſicians have been far from the right way; and therefore it falls out oft-times, when you think by your falſe receipts to cure the Canker, or the whit-flaw that you fail of it, and kil your patient before you can kil the Canker, or whit flaw: after this manner many have endeavoured to cure the Canker, and the whit-flaw, by eating medicines, by cutting or burning the ſore, and many other ſuch torturing wayes they have uſed they had alſo great confidence to do this cure by Arſenick, orpment, &amp; ſublimed Mercury. I do not deny but that many incredible cures have been done by <hi>Calcinatum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> by ſweet ſublimed <hi>Mercury,</hi> by the oil of ſweet Mercury, &amp; eſpecially by the quinteſſence of Mercury, ſo that by theſe hav been cur'd not only the diſeaſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, viz.

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Cure of thoſe Marks in the body which the patient hath from the mothers womb.</head>
                  <p>I Will now make an end of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: and in this laſt chapter I will give you a great, and a moſt ſecret cure, which farre excells all the other cures mentioned in this Treatiſe; it is this; that by theſe Vermine are cured, not only painful ſores, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z. Syrons, cankers, fiſtulaes, wolf, &amp;c. but alſo by thoſe Vermine ſuch marks may be taken away, which appear in us in their viſible ſhape and colour without any pain, and were imprinted upon ſome part of our body while we were yet in the womb, by the imagination of our mothers, they being ſtirred up thereto by fears or ſtrong deſires.</p>
                  <p>Now how that the mother by her Imagination imprints a mark, not upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170174:83"/> her ſelf, but upon the child in her womb; I have explained it in my book concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Imagination; but how theſe marks which we have from our mothers ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination may be taken out of our bodies again, and cured, that I will ſhew you here in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>And firſt you muſt ſtrictly obſerve theſe marks, of what ſhape and colour they are, if they be like a worm, or ſnake, or toad egge. You muſt alſo enquire of the mother of the perſon who hath that mark concerning the colour of the Vermine which ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rd up her imagination; and at what time, day, or hour; yea, you muſt know if you can, the very moment of her imagination. You muſt alſo know the cauſe of her imagination, &amp; why ſhe touched any part of her body at that time: but becauſe it is ſeldom, that the mother can fully enform you of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, therfore you muſt have recourſe to Aſtronomy, and by it you may have a ful information; according to which you muſt proceed. If the mark be in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a worm, then you muſt take a worm ſuch a one, with which the mark agreeth beſt, according to the information: and if that worm was alive when the mother
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170174:83"/> ſaw it, then you muſt lay the worm alive upon the mark, and ſo keep it at the mark till it dieth, and no longer.</p>
                  <p>But if it was dead before ſhe ſaw it, then you muſt lay a dead worm upon the mark, which you muſt keep at the mark till it be putrified. You muſt alſo obſerve the time when the mothers Imagination was moved by the ſight of this worme; and in the ſame time you muſt binde the worme upon the mark: if it was in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp;c. then you muſt binde the worme upon the mark in the Summer time.</p>
                  <p>If the Mothers Imagination was moved by a ſtrong deſire after any thing, then her child which hath ſuch a marke muſt be ſatiated and filled with the thing deſired; but if the mothers Imagination was from feare of a worm, then the party, who hath the mark muſt be put in fear when the worm is laid to the marke. So the marke ſhall be rooted out: howbeit it is not yet quite brought out of the skinne. But to doe this, you muſt take <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and waſh the skin with it; and ſo in the ſpace of eight or fourteene
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170174:84"/> dayes the old skin ſhall fall off, and a new fair skin ſhall come in its place after the ſame manner. All marks not only of beaſts or Vermine, but alſo of fruits, or of any thing elſe in our bodies, may be taken away and cured by theſe things, which cauſed thoſe marks, being uſed in that manner, as hath been now ſaid of worms.</p>
                  <p>This is a moſt ſecret cure, which never any revealed before me: and I am not aſhamed to reveal it, for I am the firſt who by experience have found the truth of it.</p>

               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD hath created every thing needful for the uſe of man, and it is eaſily gotten: that which is leſs uſeful, is not ſo plentiful: ſo God hath appointed. Now Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is a thing very uſeful to man, which he needs not fetch from beyond ſeas, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he may have it at hand. Nor yet they who live beyond ſea need theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which grow here: and ſo I may ſay of Salt, that, as it is of great uſe to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170174:85"/> man, ſo there is great quantity of it, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to all mens uſes.</p>
                  <p>There be two uſes of Salt, of which we will here eſpecially take notice, <hi>viz.</hi> it ſeaſoneth meates, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth diſeaſes. That meate which a man eates without Salt, is never well and perfectly digeſted; for it is the nature of Salt to correct eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the digeſtion of it; it is the true Corrector of all meates uſual to be eaten. And whatſoever meat is not ſeaſoned by Salt, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome. Let your meate bee moderately Salted, not too much, nor too little; this will helpe dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but when meate is not Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſlightly Salted, it turns to a thin, wateriſh, or ſlimy blood, and the fleſh which is bred of ſuch meate, is ſubject to corruption, and to all diſeaſes: thoſe who cannot endure any ſaltiſhneſs in any thing, but whatſoever they eat is very freſh, moſt commonly they are weaker then others; their complexion is worſe, and they are eaſily infected with any diſeaſe. Our Nature would have nothing but what is corrected
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170174:85"/> and ſeaſoned by Salt, and boyled or otherwiſe prepared by the fire; unleſs we give way to appetire to eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things raw and unprepared, as onions, Rhadiſhes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Salt is the earthly balſome of man, and of all things elſe: And where no Salt is, there is the beginning of putrefaction. It is Salt only which preſerveth both dead things and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from putrefaction. In things living, their Salt which is in them preſerveth them; there is Salt in the blood of every living creature, which preſerveth them that they doe not putrifie while they are alive. There is a Salt not only in living creatures, but alſo in herbs, mettals, ſtones, and all Vegetables; there is not any thing, but it hath in it a Salt proper to it, as appeares by thoſe ſeveral kinds of Salts which are extracted out of ſeveral things.</p>
                  <p>As Balſome preſerveth from putrefaction, ſo doth Salt; in this it is like balſome; nay, it is of a higher Nature, and more ſubtle then balſome: Whatſoever wants Salt, it cannot continue, bu
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170174:86"/> it decayeth and putrifieth: man, beaſt, and every thing elſe muſt have this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving power of Salt in it: we ſee by experience many things, (as fleſh and fiſh, &amp;c.) preſerved by Salt; yea, there is not any thing, but it may be preſerved by Salt, which is to be done not by a ſprinkling only, or mixing of the Salt with the thing to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but the Salt, muſt be prepared: and if the Salt be made a breeding or engendring Salt, it will preſerve any thing a very long time, if wood or clay be laid in it, they will become hard like ſtones. Whatſoever is ſprinkled with this breeding Salt, it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, or alter, but in time it grows to be of a ſtony nature. This breeding Salt, howbeit it drieth, and at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth and periſheth, yet it ſo congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and becomes ſo firm and hard, that it can endure in the air, water, or earth alike.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Salt is wonderfully good for the preſervation of health: it is of great worth to us, not only in ſeaſoning of meat; but it is alſo a ſingular reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for wounds; for if wounds be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, in which this ſalt is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170174:86"/> they ſhall thereby be preſerved a whole year from corruption, ſo that if a wound in the Summer time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the beginning of the dog-dayes incline to corruption: the way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, is by this waſhing: this will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hinder the breeding of worms in wounds, and if there be any worms in the wounds, it will bring them out. This is a great ſecret in Chirurgery: and let not Surgeons &amp;c be aſhamed to uſe ſuch a water They do indeed uſe other remedies, whereby corruption and worms are bred in wounds, which they can no way afterwards help: and thus by their remedies they oft-times undoe their patients. But let the true and faithful Phyſician uſe this waſhing in the cure of wounds; for wounds being kept clean by this, nature it ſelf will do the reſt of the cure. This waſhing cureth wounds after the ſame manner, as a dog by licking cureth his ſoars or cuts</p>
                  <p>Where Salt is made, there is a kind of liquor like oyl, ſo thick, that an egg laid into it will not ſink. Concerning this liquor, obſerve, that thoſe who have groſſe bodies full of blood, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or they who are troubled with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170174:87"/> defluxions, or are troubled with the Gout, or are troubled with a looſneſs, or have ſwollen legs &amp;c. if they waſh themſelves with this liquor, then all ſuperfluous, hurtfull humors in the body ſhall be thereby dried up; and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes which come of ſuch humors ſhall be quite cured; ſo that you ſhall never be troubled with theſe diſeaſes again; by it alſo are cured all running ſores of the legs, if they be waſhed with it: and it cureth alſo the itch and ſcab. This liquor is better then any natural Bath; in a word, it is a powerfull and moſt perfect remedy of the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the body, and of all diſeaſes coming of thoſe humors, it makes the body dry, ſound, and nimble. Let a Phyſician ſearch into the natures of all Bathes, and compare them with the Vertues of this liquor; he ſhall find that this liquor doth far exceed them all; this liquor never doth any hurt to any part of the body; whereas we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promiſe ſo much ſafety in any Bath.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when the phyſician hath any patients troubled with ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humours, or defluxions, let him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170174:87"/> direct his patients to have recourſe to this liquor to waſh themſelves with it; and if there be any diſeaſe to which their patient is enclined, this liquor will conſume that diſeaſe in the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, that it ſhall never afterward trouble the patient: and if the diſeaſe be already begun; this will drive it out of the body. But for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to direct their Patients to goe to Baths, it is ridiculous: ſeeing they do not throughly know the nature of thoſe Baths. Let us alwaies chooſe that which is beſt and ſafeſt.</p>
                  <p>When you would uſe ſalt, uſe it alone as it is in it ſelf, without altering it, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing to it. There be many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts in which they add ſeveral things to ſalt to qualifie it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Cummin, Fennel, Cinnamon, &amp;c. but ſuch additions are vain, they are not agreeable to the nature of ſalt, and thereby the ſalt is turned out of the right courſe of its operation; therefore when you would uſe ſalt to ſeaſon meats, and to further concoction, take it alone as it is in it ſelf: but when you would uſe ſalt for diſeaſes, you may fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt correct it, and perfect it; the vertue of it muſt not be leſſened, but rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:170174:88"/>
                  <p>Salt, as we uſe it commonly in ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our meats, it is in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>Salt burned in a hot fire, ſometime is more powerful by one degree, then the former ſalt; and the liquor of ſalt is more powerful by two degres: thus the ſtrength of it may be increaſed from one degree to another; till it comes to the twenty fourth degree; if you know the wayes of preparing it and the additions.</p>
                  <p>I have before ſpoken of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Salt upon bodies which are full of humours: now I will ſhew you in what method you ſhall proceed, and how you ſhall uſe it: Firſt, the patient troubled with the abundance of hurtful humors muſt be purged with black Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore prepared in that manner as is ſet down in the Treatiſe of Hellebore: likewiſe he muſt take inwardly the <hi>Elixar</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> for ſome time, untill thoſe obſtructions and impoſthumes which are in the body be diſſolved, and the corruption<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which are in the body be purged out, and then he muſt uſe the liquor of Salt: he may uſe a Bath, made with the liquor of Salt, which may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſtrength to the ſixteenth degree;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170174:88"/> that is, it may be made as operative as if it were raiſed to ſixteen degrees; but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally it riſeth not above the thirteenth degree.</p>
                  <p>The vertue of this liquor may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed thus: If the juice of plantane, the greater or the leſſer, or of ſome ſuch herbs be mixed with this Liquor of Salt, and boyled together, ſo it ſhall become more powerful againſt the itch or ſcab, and can do more in one day, then it could in four dayes without this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This liquor of Salt is alſo good for running Sores, if you mix it with the juices of Comfrey, or ſmall ſea-buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, of which there be many kinds. This mixture is wonderfully efficacions in curing old ſores, ſo that it hath twenty degrees in curing: for as your addition is more exact, ſo its operation wil be more excellent.</p>
                  <p>If you would uſe this liquor of Salt for inward diſeaſes, as defluxions &amp;c. then do thus; after you have boiled it in the juice of Plantane, you muſt mix it with ſublimed wine, and ſo you ſhall have a medicine exalted to the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth degree of drineſs, which will
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170174:89"/> exceedingly dry up all defluxions, or any ſuperfluous humor in the body.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of preparing Salt, viz. by diſtilling a water from ſalt, which is done thus; beat Salt and Rhadiſhes together, and let the Salt diſſolve with it, then diſtill a water from it, the which you ſhall mix with the juice of Plantane, the juice of Celandine, and the juice of ſmall ſea buck-horn, and the juice of Comfrey; of each alike much; this mixture doth exceed the twenty fourth degree in drineſſe; it can dry up the Haemorrodes, and all kinds of looſneſſe of the belly, albeit they be ſuch as hardly can be cured by other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. This liquor of Salt, with theſe additions, is of ſuch vertue, that it farre exceedeth all the ſyrups, or purges, or any other medicines of the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhops; for there is not any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in the Apothecaries ſhops which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the fourth degree: whereas theſe medicines of mine are raiſed above 24 degrees, yea, above 32. degrees; by theſe medicines of mine the diſeaſe is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly over-powred, ſo that the patient who uſeth them needs not doubt of his health; this mixture is alſo ſingularly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170174:89"/> good for wounds, and all kinds of ſores.</p>
                  <p>There be ſome other wayes of prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liquor of ſalt, whereby the vertue of it is hightned to 24 degrees as this; take of common ſalt, and of ſalt nitre of each alike much, put them in a crucible, and ſet your crucible in a wind furnace, t ll they run together like metal then take theſe two ſalts, and lay them in a moiſt place till they diſſolve to a liquor, the which liquor hath 24 degrees of a drying vertue, which is ſo ſubtle, and ſo powerful in operation, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, and if you would have this drying faculty yet greater, you ſhall add the ſame things to this liquor which are added to the liquor of ſalt in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, and you muſt proceed in the ſame manner, as I have ſhewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and having added theſe things to this liquor, if you diſtil it again, you ſhall thereby much more encreaſe the drying faculty of it, ſo that by ſuch additions and preparations you may bring its drying faculty to four and thirty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                  <p>It will not be amiſs if Salt be burned in hot fire ſometime, and afterwards it be mix'd with theſe juices before mentioned
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170174:90"/> or any other which you find to be beſt; and then if you diſſolve it into a liquor and diſtill it &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There be ſeveral things which will much augment the drying faculty of Salt; if you beat them together with Salt, and put them in a wind-furnace till the Salt run like metal, viz. Bole Armoniack, the flower of braſs, <hi>Terra ſigillata, Chimolea, Tutia, Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris.</hi> — Having taken them out of the furnace, lay them in a moiſt place til the Salt diſſolve to a liquor; this liquor keep for your uſe.</p>
                  <p>If you mix common Salt with Salt niter, of each alike much, and put them together in a wind furnace, till they runne together like metall; after they are cooled, lay them in a moiſt place, till they be diſſolved to a liquor: take this liquor and diſtill it; and that water which you diſtill from it, pour it again upon the grounds which were left in the diſtilling; and if you do thus three or four times, or oftner, <hi>viz.</hi> diſtilling, and pouring the water again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grounds, you ſhall, ſo doing, have a water of a ſingular drying and binding vertue: and if Crocus Martis, or Cerus,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170174:90"/> or the flower of braſs be added to it, they will exalt this drying faculty to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree. Note, that if you adde the juice of unripe ſloes to the liquor before it be diſtilled, and then proceed as hath been ſaid: it will be made thereby very powerfull in binding and cloſing wounds or ſores, ſearching to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of any ſore.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I have thought fit to ſhew you concerning Salt, and the vertues of it, and preparations of it: for others who have undertaken to write of the natures of medicines have not written any thing of this, becauſe they themſelves know not the Art, how to exalt the Vertue of a medicine from four degrees, to twenty four, or thirty two degrees; this Art I have here ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you; and it is a worthy and excellent Art thus to augment the Vertues of Medicines; for when our natures meet with ſuch medicines which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves powerful, they do more readily work with ſuch medicines.</p>
                  <p>Many have taken great pains in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Herbals, and concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and properties of meats and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: but if you take notice of it,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170174:91"/> you will find that they writ nothing but what they have heard from others, and whether theſe things be true or falſe, they know not: after them comes the later and modern writers, who gathering together many things out of the writings of the ancient phyſitians make up large volumus, not caring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they writ truth or lies.

                     </head>
                     <p>MAny have written much of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, but none have truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Vertues of it, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves knew it not; it was their ambition which moved them to write ſuch unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vain books.</p>
                     <p>But I have found by experience theſe Vertues of Brimſtone, which I here deſcribe. And I aſſure you, that ſo great are the vertues of Brimſtone, that we cannot admire them enough: that if God doth not hinder, then it muſt be the fault of the artiſt, when the effect of the Brimſtone is not anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its vertue; and indeed moſt Phyſicians and Chymiſts can doe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170174:92"/> nothing but prate; little of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or skil appears in publick; there are not many medicines which can excell brimſtone, or can be compared to it for its Vertues, both in Phyſick and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, which are wonderful: but it is not to be uſed either in Phyſick or Chimiſtry before it be prepared: and when it is rightly prepared, it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent medicine.</p>
                     <p>It may be prepared thus; let it be ſublimated twice or thrice from Myrrh and Aloe; then take of this ſublimed brimſtone ten ounces, of Roman Myrrh one ounce and a halfe, of the beſt Aloepaticum one ounce, of Oriental Saffron half an ounce; mix them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and make them a powder which you ſhall keep for your uſe. This is an excellent preſervative againſt the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, pluriſie, all impoſthumes, and all putrefactions of the body: if you take ſome of it in a morning, you need not fear that day the peſtilence or pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Another way of preparing brimſtone is thus; let it be ſublimated oft-times from Coperas, (the oftner you do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the better it will be) and ſo it draweth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170174:92"/> the ſpirit and eſſence of the Coperas into it ſelf: being thus prepared, it is a good preſervative and remedy for all fevers, and all Coughs, whether new or old; it is alſo a preſervative for the falling ſickneſſe, and cureth it in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if it be taken daily, it preſerveth health very much. It is alſo a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of wine, it will keep wine a long time from decaying, it will correct it, and make it found and wholeſome: whatſoever impurity is in the wine, it will purge it out; and the wine which is thus corrected by this brimſtone, it will not breed the ſtone or ſand in kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or bladder, nor Apoplexie, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of impoſthume, nor defluxions, nor coughs, nor fevers, &amp;c. When the brimſtone is well purged from its impurities, and poyſon, and that which is uſeleſſe in it, then it is a worthy Medicine, it is a precious jewel.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of brimſtone, a yellow brimſtone, a red brimſtone, a purple, a black, a white, and an aſhie coloured brimſtone; but the yelloweſt brimſton is the beſt to be uſed in phyſick; the other kinds of brimſtone have much of Arſenick, and Realgare &amp;c. in them,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170174:93"/> and therefore they are not fit to bee uſed in phyſick they are beſt for Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: they are alſo good for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſeaſes of the body, as tetters, &amp;c. becauſe of the arſenical ſpirits which are in them, they are better for this purpoſe then the yellow brimſtone, ſo that if they be often ſublimed from Coperas, or allom, or ſalt Gemme, they will thereby become ſo ſubtle that they can root out tetters, or any kind of ſcabs; for this one thing we may well eſteem of brimſtone as of a great treaſure that it can take away theſe outward faults of the body, which are rooted within the body: even as the loadſtone draws iron to it, and makes it leave the place where it was; So there is in brimſtone a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick power, which cannot be fully deſcribed; ſuch miracles of nature, are manifeſted by the experiences of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy. God hath given to us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient medicines; but it is our fault that we are not more diligent in preparing of them, in ſeparating the good from that which is bad and uſeleſs in them. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine now is not an Art, as it was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: for in ſtead of phyſical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we have ntohing but prating.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:170174:93"/>
                     <p>I will now ſhew you the way how to prepare brimſtone for ſome Chymical u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thus; melt your brimſtone in ſome lin-ſeed oyl, and the oyle with the brimſtone, will become like a piece of liver; take this and diſtil it, and you ſhall have come out firſt a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>quor like milk, afterwards will come a red oyl like blood: it is to be obſerved that this white liquor, and the red oyle are not confounded in the diſtilling; but they come out ſeverally; and when they are diſtilled, they do not mix, but the white liquor goeth to the bottom, and the red oyl ſwims in the top. Some have attempted to make ſilver with the white l quor, and to make gold with the red oyle but in vain. I know, that never any thing would bee effected with this white liquor, neither by the ancient, nor by the modern Chymiſts; but in the red oyl are ſecrets worthy to be known. I will ſhew you one or two ſecrets of this oyle. If a Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall or Beril after it is well poliſhed, be put into this oyle, and lye in it three years, ſo it will become a Jacinth; or if you put a pale coloured Ruby in this oyl, and let it lie in it nine years; it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170174:94"/> will become ſo clear and bright, that it will ſparkle and ſhine in the dark like a live coal; this experience hath taught. Some Alchimiſts have tryed to turne a Jacinth into a Carbuncle, leaving the Jacinth in this oyl ſome time, but my experience tells me that this cannot be done. If you put a Saphir into this oyl, and let it lie in it ſome time, it will make the Saphir be of a blewiſh colour, mixed with a green. Thus likewiſe other precious ſtones may be coloured; this is the only thing which can help the colour of precious ſtones; there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any other way known how to give colours to precious ſtones, or how to heighten their colours if they be low, but only by the red oyl of Brimſtone: but glaſs cannot receive any colour from this oyl.</p>
                     <p>You have heard what operation this oyl hath upon precious ſtones; now I will ſhew you what operation it hath upon metals. Put beaten ſilver into this oyl, and when it hath lien in it ſome time, it will be turned into a blackiſh golden powder, you muſt let this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lye in the oyl till it be fixed; for if you take it out before its time, you will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170174:94"/> find it to be an unripe thing, which will not endure the fire, becauſe it is not yet fixed: but of this I will ſay no more. Obſerve this of the Brimſtone, that the more it is purified and exalted, ſo its operation will be quicker and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and by it metals or ſtones may be fixed; any who will try it, may aſſure themſelves that they ſhal do it. It is true, that the labour of Alchimy is the moſt dangerous of any: in Chymick opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is great danger and difficulty, and therefore it requires a man of long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and great experience, who muſt have his knowledge not by reading, or by the report of others, but by his own experience.</p>
                     <p>You may take notice of one thing more concerning this oyl: you have heard that it gives colours in the higheſt degree both to ſtones and to met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> but whether it can give them the Vertues with the Colours, or if it can heighten their Vertues; this is to be doubted; I can ſay nothing to it.</p>
                     <p>Again obſerve, that there is a balſom in brimſtone, which will not ſuffer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a living, or a dead body to putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or decay; yea, it ſo preſerveth the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170174:95"/> body, that neither any influence of the ſtars, nor corruption can touch the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. If you take circulated Coperas, that is, that Coperas whoſe water is ſo long circulated upon its own body, till it ſtayes fix'd in its body, ſo that the force of fire cannot make it leave its body any more: your circulating veſſel wherein your Coperas is, muſt be ſet in warm dung, or warm water, then will the moiſture of the Coperas vapour up in the glaſs, and fall back againe to the Coperas, and thus you muſt keep your circulating veſſel in the warm dung, or hot water, untill the moiſture of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras will not riſe up any more in the glaſs, and then you have circulated Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras; mix your brimſtone made into a powder with this circulated Coperas, and ſublime the brimſtone ſo often from the Coperas, till it ſtayes with the Coperas, and will aſcend no more, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:170174:96"/>
                  <p>In this diſcourſe concerning Coperas, I will obſerve this Order; firſt, I will ſpeak of its Vertues before it be prepared: then I will ſhew you the Vertues of it prepared. I will ſhew you what vertues it hath in medicine, and what vertues it hath in Alchimy. In medicine it is good, both for inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and outward diſeaſes; it is good for an hereditary leproſie, for tetters, or wild ſcabs &amp;c. and for many other diſeaſes, where other medicines fail, and can do no good; the powerful medicines which are made of Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras ſearcheth till it find the root of the diſeaſe which it conſumes, and ſo cureth the diſeaſe throughly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preparations of Coperas ſhould be well known to every phyſician. The Coperas diſſolved in water, and the Coperas calcined or burned, the green oyl of Coperas, the red and white oyl of Coperas, each of theſe have their ſeveral vertues, and how many wayes it is changed, ſo often it gets ſome new vertue. This one thing, viz. Coperas, doth confound all the Apothecaries and Writers both of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> this alone can fill the fourth part of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170174:96"/> their ſhops, and cure the fourth part of diſeaſes: if they knew how to prepare this rightly, they needed not ſo many boxes, pots, glaſſes, &amp;c. in which there is nothing but cheats. What needs a phyſician gather together ſo many boxes, and ſo many beyond ſea me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines? if he be provident and wiſe, he needs not go far, or trouble himſelf much to find out medicines for all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes as good as India, or Egypt, or Barbary, or Greece can give.</p>
                  <p>There are many kinds of Coperas, they differ according to the pits whence they are taken. If you would know the goodneſſe of the Coperas in Phyſick, diſſolve the coperas in ſome liquor, and give it to them who are troubled with the worms, and let them drink it: and as it drives out the worms, ſo alſo it is good for other phyſical uſes. But the goodneſs of Coperas for Chimick uſes, appears by this; viz. if it turn Iron into a deep coloured, and malleable Copper: for there is great affinity betwixt iron an Coperas, and the beſt Coperas makes the beſt Copper out of iron. This is not a thing to be much admired, there are many ſuch things done by nature:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170174:97"/> we ſee lead turned into quick ſilver by the water of ſalt-borace, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo other metals are changed one into another by minerals; — ſo that not only Coperas, but there are alſo other things which can change met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. The reaſon why theſe things are not knowne, is this; becauſe when cheaters get the knowledge of ſuch things, they keep them ſecret for their own gains, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their purſes and kitchins. In <hi>Hungaria</hi> there is a River which comes from a Coperas Mine, or runs through ſome Coperas Mine, if iron be laid in the water of this river ſome time, it will be changed to bee as it were, all ruſt, take this lump of ruſt, and put it in a wind-furnace, and you ſhall have good Copper, which cannot be again turned into iron.</p>
                  <p>There is another way to try the goodneſſe of Coperas for Chymiſtry, thus; put your Coperas in a pot, and ſet the pot in the fire till your Coperas be turned into a red powder, then melt it, and if it yeild Copper, it is good for Chymiſtry, but not ſo good for phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. There is another way to know the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170174:97"/> goodneſs of the coperas by the colour; that coperas which is of a ſea green, and is throughly green without any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour mixed with it, it is not ſo good for phyſick, as that which hath red and vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtreaks in it, and that which being laid in the open air turns whitiſh, it is the beſt to make the green and white oyl of it: but that which turns ruddiſh or yellowiſh, from it we draw the red oyle: and by theſe marks the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Alchymiſt may know whar cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras he ſhould chuſe for his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>There is one tryal more which I will adde, to know the goodneſſe of coperas, it is this, if your coperas with galls make good ink, then the coperas is good; but if it make a wateriſh ink, and not a good black ink, then it is not good coperas.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Medicinal Vertues of Coperas unprepared, and of Coperas calcined.</head>
                  <p>HAving given you the marks to know good Coperas, I will now ſhew you the phyſical vertues of it. And firſt, of unprepared Coperas, and of calcined Coperas. Obſerve this, that Coperas is an excellent purge fit to be uſed for great and difficult diſeaſes of the ſtomack; it falls out ſometimes that by hurtful meats and drinks, or bad diet, the ſtomack is weakned, and the patient falls into ſome long and tedious diſeaſe, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with him till his death, or after a long diſeaſe he may be troubled with the cramp, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe by intemperancy oft-times comes fevers, or looſneſſe &amp;c. Now there is nothing better for all ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170174:98"/> then to be purged with Coperas, which ſome do Allegorically call <hi>Gryllum;</hi> you muſt take ſo much of it at a time, as you can take up upon the point of a knife ſix times: if it doth not work, then take the ſame quantity of it again; if it doth not yet work, take the ſame quantity of it the third time, and that will be enough: to thoſe who are weak, you muſt give it in wine, or water; but to thoſe who are ſtrong, and are bound in their body, give it in the ſpirit of wine, and ſo it will throughly purge upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. There are many other ſtrong purgatives, as Hellebore, Spurge, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida, &amp;c. but none do purge ſo well as Coperas; the reaſon of it is this, becauſe in the Coperas there is a ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſharpneſſe, and a cleanſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty (which is not in Hellebore, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquintida &amp;c.) whereby it hath a full and perfect operation in purging; the Hellebore, Coloquintida &amp;c. have only a laxative faculty; but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras, beſides its laxative faculty, hath alſo a ſaltiſhneſſe, which is of ſuch a nature, that whereſoever it meetes with any wormes in the body, it kills
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170174:99"/> them: none of the other purgatives can do this. Doubtleſſe that purgative which hath ſowrneſſe and ſaltiſhneſſe joyned with its laxative vertue; it muſt needs cleanſe and purge ſingularly well: wherefore (I do think) that Coperas is for the inward diſeaſes of the body a more excellent purge then any other. I need not name all thoſe inward diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for which it is good, ſeeing I have ſo largely deſcribed to you the Nature and Vertues of it; only this I would have you obſerve, that it is the ſafeſt, the moſt powerful; and moſt profitable purge that can be taken for all diſeaſes of the ſtomack, for the falling ſickneſſe, and for worms: if it be given in a right time, and in a right manner, the perſon being alſo conſidered to whom it is to be given &amp;c. As for calcined Coperas, that is, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras burned in the fire till it comes to be a red powder; you muſt know, that it is not to be taken inwardly; it is to be uſed only in Chirurgy; it is good for rotten old ſores, which will not yeild to remedies, it prepares the ſore, and makes way for the cure. You ſhall uſe it thus; take the calcined Coperas very hot, and quench it in vinegar, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170174:99"/> thus do ſeveral times; then dry it, ſtrow it upon the plaiſter which ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſore; this will bring a hard ſcurfe upon the ſore; this ſcurfe you muſt looſen from the ſore, and get it off with oyl or freſh butter; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the cure will be eaſie: but if the ſore will not yet yield to the remedy, then you may think, that there is yet ſome poiſon in the ſore, which muſt be brought out by the oyl of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras; for if it be a very malignant ſtubborn ſore, then the calcined Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras is not ſubtle enough to ſearch to the bottome of it. But if you would have this calcined Coperas more piercing, you may do it thus; ſprink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e this calcined Coperas with vinegar in which Coperas is diſſolved, let it dry, and ſprinkle it again, and thus doe four or five times; when it is thus prepared, it will ſearch to the bottome of the ſore. But the beſt way of preparing this calcined Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, is thus; diſtill the water off from the Coperas, the grounds remaining is calcined Coperas: put the water diſtilled to the ſaid grounds, diſtill it again; do thus ſo often till no water
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170174:100"/> will come from the grounds. If you uſe this for any ſore, you will find it to be very ſubtil and piercing. In curing ſores you muſt conſider well the degrees of ſores, and that which will not yeild to the calcined Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, muſt bee cured by the oyle or water of Coperas. So that if wee can do no good by the calcined Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras, wee muſt not therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but we muſt prepare it further by diſtillation; and in ſo doing wee may bring this medicine to that height that it can cure all kinds of ſores, as Canker, wolf, fiſtuls, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>ALchimy hath diſcovered many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſecrets to phyſicians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great cures have been done, and therefore phyſicians formerly when they entred upon the ſtudy of medicine: they alſo ſtudied Alchimy, becauſe it is the mother of many worthy phyſical ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. Theſe two Arts, <hi>viz.</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and Alchimy, as companions, were ſtudied together till thoſe talkative cheaters, the humoriſts poiſoned Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and made that virgin to be a ſtrumpet, and ſo muſt remain, ſo long as they prevail; for when ignorant men take upon them the profeſſion of an art which they know not; that Art certainly doth ſuffer violence, and muſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170174:101"/> be wronged. Thus Alchymy hath been wronged in many things, eſpecially in Coperas, how many deceitful oyls and ſpirits of Coperas have we in ſtead of that true oyl, and true ſpirit of Coperas which the ancient phyſicians uſed; they had the true ſpirit of Coperas, and they exalted it to the higheſt degree, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they perfectly cured any falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in men, women, or children: but others ſince, who were unskilfull in Alchymy, thinking to take a better way, have endeavoured to draw out the ſpirit, and to exalt the vertues of the Coperas otherwiſe, and ſo leaving the firſt ſecret way of the Ancients, which they loſt; they laboured to draw the oyle out of the calcined Coperas, but in vain; for what they draw out of it is of no uſe, for that which cureth the falling ſickneſs muſt have a ſubtle, piercing ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The true ſpirit, or true oyl of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras hath ſuch a piercing, ſearching na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it goeth through the whole body, and nothing can eſcape it, and when it meets with the diſeaſe, it reſiſts it, and overcomes it in its own place: now a phyſician cannot certainly know
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170174:101"/> the ſeat and center of the diſeaſe, and therefore he hath need to have ſuch remedies as will ſearch through the whole body, and find out the diſeaſe, and this is the reaſon why Humoriſt-doctors can never cure this diſeaſe, and ſo they ſhame their profeſſion; becauſe they have not the right remedies which can do it. I can certifie this, that the oyl which the common Alchymiſts draw out of the calcined Coperas (which the Apothecaries call the ſpirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial) it hath nothing of a ſubtle, or piercing nature in it: it is a meer earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, dead thing, which hath no profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operation.</p>
                  <p>It is much to be lamented, that through unskilfulneſs the true way ſhould be ſuppreſſed, and the falſe ſhould be thus received in its ſtead; I am perſwaded that the divel doth this, for this end, that the ſect of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſt-Doctors may be prevalent, and that the diſeaſed may not re-enjoy their health.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my purpoſe; I will now ſhew you how you may get the true oyl, and the true ſpirit of Coperas, and how the Ancients found out the ſpirit:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170174:102"/> firſt, they diſtilled a water from the Coperas: this water they diſtilled alone, &amp; circulated it till it was fully corrected, as their way teacheth; and this water they uſed for many diſeaſes, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſeaſes, as falling ſickneſſe &amp;c. and outward diſeaſes, and thereby they performed wonderful cures: then they took this water ſo corrected, and they powred it upon the grounds which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the firſt diſtillation; and they diſtilled it again from the grounds; thus they did eight or ten times with a ſtrong fire, whereby the wet ſpirits were united to the dry ſpirits ſo firmly that by continuall diſtilling, the dry ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at laſt came out with the wet ſpirits: then they took theſe two ſpirits thus firmly united, and put them in a glaſſe veſſel, where they exalted them to the higheſt degree: theſe two ſpirits, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus exalted, the Ancients found them to have greater operation then the foreſaid water alone. and with this one medicine they could do more then the Humoriſt-Doctors can do with all the medicines they have. Artiſts do adde to this medicine ſublimed wine, to make it more piercing.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170174:102"/>
                  <p>Now I will ſhew you my way which I uſe, and commend it to all phyſicians; eſpecially for the falling-ſickneſs, which is cured only by this ſpirit of Coperas: my way is thus; I put ſo much ſpirit of wine to the Coperas, as the Coperas will drink in; then I diſtil a water from the Coperas, and ſo I proceed in the ſame manner as is ſaid before: when the medicine is perfected, I adde to it theſe things following, <hi>viz.</hi> to one ounce of the ſpirit of Coperas, I adde two ounces of the corrected ſpirit of Tartar, and two drams of the warer of Treakle camphorated. The patient who is troubled with the falling-ſickneſs, ſhould take this medicine before his fit come upon him, he may take it twice or thrice a day ſo much of it as the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſhall appoint. Nature cannot afford a better medicine then this for the falling ſickneſs. My way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this medicine is the ſame which was uſed by the Ancients; I only add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ſpirit of wine before I diſtill it: and I adde to the medicine when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, theſe things which I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>This precious ſpirit of Coperas is not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170174:103"/> only good for the falling-ſickneſſe, but alſo for all diſeaſes of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſounding, extaſie, &amp;c. It is alſo good for all obſtructions and inward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumes for fits of the mother, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of the mother. Phyſicians might find out many other excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in this ſpirit of Coperas if they were diligent in ſearching them; and if they would ſhew themſelvs good and faithful phyſicians and careful of the health of their patients: curſed be all thoſe phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians who regard only their own gain, and not the health of their patients, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe patients who are afflicted with that ſad diſeaſe, the falling-ſickneſs. I hope all good people will approve of what I have done here: and truly I have deſcribed the way of preparing this ſpirit of Coperas as clearly as I can. The main buſineſs is this; that the ſpirit be well extracted and exalted as much as may be, and that it be made of a moſt piercing Nature, by the addition of thoſe things which I have named before, that it may reach the root of the diſeaſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former, there is another way of preparing it, thus; put the Coperas in a circulatory veſſel, which you muſt ſet
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170174:103"/> in warm dung, or boiling water, untill no moiſture riſe up within the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating veſſel: and ſo you need not diſtill of the water, and return it; then put ſome ſpirit of wine to it, and circulate them together to the grounds, as the way of the Ancients teacheth you, for when the moiſture will not vapour up any more from the Coperas, then the wet &amp; dry ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Coperas are firmly united: and this is the true ſpirit of Coperas. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have ſaid enough concerning the ſpirit of Coperas; now I will teach you how to make the oyl of Coperas; it is done thus; put your Coperas in a diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling veſſel, which diſtills by deſcent; and ſo let it be diſtilled, and you ſhall have an oyl white or green, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Coperas, for ſome Coperas yeelds a white oyle, and ſome Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras yeilds a green oyl; the green oyle is the beſt; it is indeed a moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oyl, and it hath the ſame vertues which the ſpirit of Coperas hath; for in this oyl is the ſpirit of the Coperas. If this oyle be circulated, and mixed with the ſpirit of Coperas before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; then you may aſſure your ſelf, that you have a certaine remedy for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170174:104"/> the like nature. But here you muſt obſerve, that there is no diſeaſe alone, every diſeaſe hath ſeveral ſymptomes joyned with it, and oft-times there are many diſeaſes joyned together: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the falling ſickneſs hath many grievous ſymptomes joyned with it, which muſt have their proper remedies, of which I have ſpoken largely in my treatiſe of the falling ſickneſſe: but the chief remedy for the diſeaſe it ſelfe, is this oyl and ſpirit of Coperas.</p>
                  <p>This green oyl of Coperas may be exalted to the higheſt degree, thus; let it be ſeparated from its earthlineſſe and dregs, in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the fire: by <hi>Balneum Mariae</hi> is ſeparated from it its ſuperfluous moiſture, and by the fire it is ſeparated from its earthlineſs: ſo you have the pure Oyl ſeparated from all its ſuperfluities and impurities, which you muſt circulate alone ſome time; then mix it with ſome ſpirit of wine.</p>
                  <p>You need not adde any other thing to it, when you take it only for the diſeaſe it ſelf: but if you would take ſomething alſo againſt the ſymptomes which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the diſeaſe; then you muſt adde
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170174:104"/> to this oyl of Coperas ſuch things as are proper for thoſe ſymptomes: the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent who is troubled with the falling-ſickneſſe, muſt take this oyl in the water of Piony before his fit comes upon him; we muſt conſider the fits, how they come; if they come often, or if they ſtay long, or if they be very fierce and violent; then before every ſuch fit you muſt take ſome of the oyl, and ſo ſoon as the ſpirit of this oyl comes to the root of the diſeaſe, then the fit is preſently abated, and decreaſeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: and the diſeaſe it ſelf is daily more and more leſſened: at the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this oyl, all the violence of the diſeaſe is taken away, ſo that the patient ſhall not afterwards fall nor froth at the mouth, nor beat himſelf &amp;c. he ſhall only have a ſwimming in the head, and then fall into a ſhort ſlumber: at laſt this ſwimming in the head, and ſlumbring doth alſo leave him: nevertheleſs, the patient muſt uſe ſtill the oyl, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as the nature of the diſeaſe, and condition of the patient requireth; this the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the phyſician will determine; and ſo I have done with the deſcription of the true oyl, and true ſpirit of Coperas.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the red Oyle of <hi>Coperas,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, The Spirit of <hi>Vitrial,</hi> and its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</head>
                  <p>I Will ſpeak a little concerning the Common Red Oyl of Coperas, which is Diſtilled (according to the common way of Alchymiſts) from the calcined Coperas by a Retort. Some think this Oyl better than the other true Oyl and the true Spirit of Coperas; but they are deceived. This Red Oyl is of a ſour, ſharp, corroſive nature; and therefore it muſt be uſed very warily: it muſt not be taken alone, but with other things in a Compoſition; and if it be ſo taken as it ſhould be, it is good for all Feavers or queaſineſs of the ſtomach: it is good for the ſtomach, becauſe of its ſharpneſs and ſourneſs: if the ſtomach be free from Apoſthumes, or Choler. But if there be any Apoſthumes, or Choler in the ſtomach, then this Oyl, if it be taken inwardly, it will be very hurtful to the ſtomach; for by its ſharpneſs and ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170174:105"/> it will enrage the Apoſthume: and if it meet with Choler, they will contend and boyl together mightily. Many do ſpeak much of the Vertues of this Oyl; but I could never finde theſe Vertues in it by experience which they boaſt of. I have met with many, who have boaſted, that they could do wonderful things by this Oyl: but I know, That they lyed ſhamefully. The greateſt uſe of this Oyl is for the Stone, or Sand in the Kidneys, or Bladder: it can do much good in this, it will moulder the Stone very much, and expel the Sand: yet I never knew any perfectly Cured by it, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed; for what it doth, it is by its corroſive, or eating Faculty; which certainly it cannot do much, and it muſt be with great difficulty. Therefore there muſt be ſome other way found out (than hath been hitherto uſed) to make it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. In my practice concerning the Cure of the Stone and Sand, I have there ſet down a good Compoſition made up of this Red Oyl of Coperas with other things; which is very good and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al both for the Stone, and for other Diſeaſes. This Oyl is not to be uſed but in this, or ſome ſuch Compoſition. Uſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170174:106"/> ſuch compoſitions which by experience you find to be beſt; it is a new medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and therefore to find out its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrl vertues, we ought to uſe it in ſeveral compoſitions: ſo much for its Vertues in Phyſick. Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its vertues in Chirurgery, it is a a preſent help for many difficult out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſeaſes, but it maketh great pain; it cureth the hereditary ſcab of the head called <hi>Achores:</hi> if you dip a feather in it, and annoint the ſcab with it, it will bring off all the ſcab in one whole piece: but if the firſt annointing doth it not, then you muſt annoint again, ſo often till the ſcab come off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or you may put ſome of the oyl in the water of Celendine, and mix them well together, and therewith waſh the ſcab. This oyle cureth all ſcabs, itches, wolf, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, &amp;c. Yea, all outward ſores whatſoever, if the ſore be therewith annointed; but it cauſeth great pain: and this you muſt carefully conſider, if the ſore be very malignant and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſo that the poiſon of it lieth deep, and hath infected the ſound fleſh; therefore that you may preſerve
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170174:106"/> the ſound fleſh, that it be not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, you ſhall uſe with this oyl, our Oppodeltoch plaiſter, deſcribed in my great Chirurgie. This medicine is ſo powerful and operative, that it can help many ſuch ſores, for which other remedies are too weak: it will not be unfitting if you mix this oyle with ſome good oyntment, ſo it will be much milder, but duller in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; it will not cauſe ſo great pain, but it cannot be uſed without ſome pain. This red oyl of Coperas will be much better, and more powerful, if by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling it you bring it to be a ſpirit, and ſo it will cure the afore-mentioned diſeaſes in leſſer quantity, and better. What I have here told you concerning this red oyl of Coperas, I have had the experience of it.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Chymical vertues of <hi>Coperas,</hi> how it changeth Iron into good Copper, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>I Have ſpoken largely, and enough of the medicinal vertues of Coperas, and how it ſhould be prepared. I will now ſhew you what may be done with Coperas in Chymiſtry. Coperas can change Iron into good Copper, whereby we may ſee much of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Nature; for it is not the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt who doth this, but it is Nature with the diligent labour of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt; and it is to be admired, that a metal ſhould leave its own nature, and become another metal; by this we ſee what priviledges God hath beſtowed upon Nature for mans uſe; whence wee may conclude, that there may be greater changes wrought in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which are unknown to us. It cannot be denied, but that there are many
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170174:107"/> ſecrets unknown to us, which God will not reveal, becauſe we are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of them. Now to change Iron into Copper is not ſo much as to turn iron into gold; God hath made known to us the leſſer, but the other greater ſhall not be revealed till the time comes of the full knowledge of all ſecrets of Arts and Sciences, viz. when <hi>Helias</hi> ſhall come. But to come to our purpoſe in hand, to ſhew you how you may turn Iron into Copper by Coperas, it is thus; Take a thin plate of pure Iron which hath no other metal mixed with it, one pound; of quick-ſilver half a pound, of Coperas a quarter of a pound, of ſalt Armoniack one ounce and a halfe, put them all together in an iron pot, and put to them a good quantity of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſet your pot upon the fire, and let it boil, and be alwaies ſtirring the things which are in the pot with a ſtick; when the vinegar is conſumed, you muſt put to them more vinegar, and more Coperas; you muſt keep the pot upon the fire boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten or twelve hours, and then you ſhall find all your iron gone into the quick-ſilver; then take a bag made of thin leather, or cotten—&amp; put the quick-ſilver
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170174:108"/> with the iron into the bag, and preſs the quick-ſilver through the bag; the iron which remains in the bag, put in a melting pot, and melt it, and you ſhall have good Copper. Take of this Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and of ſilver, of each alike much, and melt them together, and the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will have ſixteen degrees of white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; this is the tryal whereby we know ſuch Copper to be made of iron; this whiteneſſe is not firm and fixed; but he who hath skill to work in Regals, he ſhall have by it a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his pains. The main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in the skilful handling of it, in which many do fail: but to turn the iron into Copper you cannot fail, if you obſerve the way which I have told you, which I have deſcribed here for this end, to confirm that truth, That one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal may be changed into another metal.</p>
                  <p>There is a very great neerneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betwixt Coperas, and Copper. If you put Coperas in a pot, and ſet it in a hot fire till it becomes to be a Red powder; then take this Red powder, and melt it upon iron, and you will find upon the iron Copper melted out of the Coperas: ſo likewiſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170174:108"/> if Copper be diſſolved in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and granulated, it will be turned into Coperas, and that which is called <hi>Viride aeris,</hi> if it be well prepared and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it will come to be Saphir-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Coperas; howbeit it may ſeem ridiculous for me to diſcourſe of ſuch things; yet it cannot be denied, but that there lurks a tincture in Coperas, which can do more, then many will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: he is a happy man who knows it. I will tell you one Chymical ſecret of the oyl of Coperas; Take the oyl of Coperas, and the oyl of quick-ſilver, mix them together, and coagulate them, and you ſhall have a Saphir of a ſtrange nature; not a Saphir ſtone, but it is like a Saphir, having a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful tincture in it, of which I will ſay no more here: whence it is evident, that God hath hid wonderful ſecrets in Nature, which we ſhould ſearch out by diligent ſtudy, rather then to ſpend our time in whoring, and drinking &amp;c. but in theſe times whoring, and other wayes of intemperancy will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant till one third part of men be killed by the Sword, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther third part deſtroyed by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170174:109"/> the world cannot continue long in this wickedneſſe: arts &amp; ſciences cannot flouriſh now. We cannot expect any good to be done, till wickedneſſe be rooted out; of neceſſity wicked men of every condition and degree ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: then ſhall come the golden age, when men ſhall be rational, and uſe their underſtanding, and live like men, not like beaſts &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I have freely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from my good affection to you, entreating all, who know the miſery of thoſe perſons who are afflicted with that ſad and grievous diſeaſe the falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that they ſeriouſly conſider what God their Creator, their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and charity towards their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour requires of them in this buſineſſe, that they do not contemn or neglect theſe vertues which God hath created in Coperas; but let Charity move you to it, to be diligent night and day, about this and ſuch things whereby you may do good to your neighbour.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170174:113"/> liquor put ſome honey or freſh butter, and boyl it again to a conſiſtence; and then you have an Oyntment which you may truſt to in the moſt difficult Cures.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another way to make Oyntments with Roſins, thus.</p>
                     <p>Take the Roſin of the Larch-tree, or Pine Roſin one pound, make it into powder, and mix it with the whites of twenty eggs, and beat them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then add to them the powder of the roots of great Comfrey half an ounce, the powder of round Birth-wort one ounce, of barley meal ſix drams.

                  <p>IF the bone is broken, without any wound in the fleſh, then we have no more to do but to ſet the bone right, and to apply ſuch Medicines, which will joyn the bone together again; but if beſides the fracture of the bone, there is alſo a wound in the fleſh, then we muſt joyn wound oyls, and wound-plaiſters before deſcribed, with fracture Medicines.</p>
                  <p>We muſt be careful to binde up the Fracture twice every day, whether it hath a wound joyned with it or not, and that the bone be not moved out of its right place; for if this be neglected, there will follow many evils upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> Inflammation and Putrefaction in the place, a Gangrene, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times death, if the fracture be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, either in reſpect of the place where it is, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore me muſt not delay the binding up of the fracture to the ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>I likewiſe adviſe you not to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ſplents, which are commonly uſed by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions in binding up fractures, for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe ſplents, without moving the bone out of its right place. Secondly, becauſe ſplents require ſtrong binding, which of neceſſity muſt cauſe inflammation in the place. Thirdly, becauſe oft-times it falls out, that a ſwelling, cauſed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation over night, may be leſſened before morning; ſo the binding ſlacks, and the Bone turns out of its right place.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the cure: If you carefully obſerve to do as hath been ſaid, it will be no hard matter to cure a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, eſpecially in thoſe who are yong: the root of great Comfrey alone, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and boiled in W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne, and applyed to the fracture, will cure it; or Birth-wort, or Snake-weed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The herb Flix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170174:122"/> if it be bruiſed and laid to the fracture, or if it be boiled in W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e and laid to the fracture, it will cure it: You may alſo cure fractures with the wound-oyles, Oyntments and Plaiſters deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed before. Nature it ſelf doth much, having a little help.</p>
                  <p>There are two things which muſt be carefully done in the cure of fractures. Firſt, If there be any congealed blood within, it muſt be diſſolved and brought out. Secondly, If there be a wound with the fracture; then after we have ſet the bone right, we muſt begin with the cure of the wound, and afterwards cure the fracture.</p>
                  <p>The ſwelling, inflammation, and pain which accompany Fractures (if not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly helped, may cauſe putrifaction and Ulcers) they may be taken away by the oyl of St. <hi>Johns</hi> wort, or the oyl of the flowers of Mullein, or ſome of the wound-oyles deſcribed in the third Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. But if by the miſ-skilfulneſs or negligence of the Chyrurgion, there is a Fiſtula, or ſome other dangerous Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer bred in the place of the Fracture, then there is no other way but to cut off the part infected.</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170174:156"/> together, have diſcovered many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicines, the chief of which are the Tinctures; but theſe Tinctures have been much abuſed by Gold Smiths, and thoſe who thought to change Metals into Gold with them: &amp; I have ſhewed in ſome other of my writings how much may be done by them, therefore I will not here ſpeak any thing of it.</p>
               <p>In former times they made Tinctures, whereby they coloured Metals &amp; purged them; and afterwards they uſed theſe Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures as Medicines for the bodies of men: what great vertues are in theſe Tinctures, are declared in the Books of Ancient Writers, which have long time been kept hidden by falſe Phyſicians, but I will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them; for I have had the experience of them, and I know they have a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful faculty in cleanſing the blood.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I now write concerning the cure of Ulcers, I conceive it fitting that I ſhew you whence I have had theſe my remedies; and I confeſs, that I have learned them in the School of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. But becauſe many errors have crept into this Art of Chymiſtry, partly through ignorance, and partly through the envy of Chymiſts; whereby thoſe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170174:157"/> who followed the practice of Chymiſtry, being much ſeduced, they were forced to ſeek new ways, and ſo of themſelves they found out many things, ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and ſome hurtful: Therefore I have endeavored to reform this Art of Chymiſtry, &amp; leaving thoſe things which are hurtful or unprofitable, I diſcover onely ſuch things which are uſeful and good for the Body of Man.</p>
               <p>This task I am able to perform ſo much the more happily, in regard my firſt ſtudies were in this way of Chymiſtry, in which I took great delight, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it with great diligence under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maſters, who were moſt skilful in ſecret Philoſophy: My Maſters were firſt, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Hohenheim,</hi> my careful and loving Father, and many others, who hid nothing from me which they knew; and beſides, I was much helped by the Books of learned men, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaius, Erhradus Laventalius,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Hipponenſis, Trithemius,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Spanheim,</hi> and other moſt learned and experienced Chymiſts.</p>
               <p>I have had alſo many Experiments from ſeveral Chymiſts, and of thoſe I will now name onely the moſt noble <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmundus,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170174:157"/> Fueger, Schwatzenſis,</hi> who maintaineth many ſervants in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chymiſtry, at great charges, and hath enriched the Art of Chymiſtry with many Experiments.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I conceive that I may very well undertake this talk, Of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chymiſtry and Phyſick; conſidering my knowledge in Philoſophy, and my skill of Chymiſtry and Phyſick: And here I will give you ſome taſte of my skill in the following Tinctures.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing there are Medicines which can preſerve the Body of Man for many Ages from Diſeaſes, Corruptions, and Superfluities; or if there be any infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or corruption in the Body, they can cure it: It ought to be the care of every
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170174:200"/> Phyſician to know them, and to know them throughly; for there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tedious Diſeaſes, and many Maladies incident to the Body of Man, which are rooted out by theſe Medicines, which prolong life.</p>
                  <p>In this diſcourſe of long Life, I will firſt give you the Theory of it, and then the practice, that you may fully know all that concerns long Life.</p>
                  <p>I would not have any to doubt of this, that life may be prolonged, for theſe two Reaſons. 1. Becauſe it doth not appear that there is any certain day or hour of any mans death. 2 Becauſe we have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine prepared for us, by him who hath created us, both to preſerve us from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and to drive out Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may conclude, that neither Diſeaſes bring Death, neither is Death the cauſe of Diſeaſes; nay, Death and Diſeaſes agree no better then fire and water: A natural Diſeaſe hates Death, as every part of the living Body hates Death.</p>
                  <p>I intend in this diſcourſe to ſpeak to thoſe of my own way, who by great skill, and daily experience have ſearched into, and do know the propertie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170174:200"/> natures of things, which are hid and unknown to preſumptuous and titular Doctors: And I do affirm this as a moſt certain truth, That the Body may be reſtored, changed to the better, yea wholly renewed: As it is to be plainly ſeen in Metals, which may be ſo purified, that they ſhall be afterwards free from any ruſt; ſo likewiſe dead Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, if they be embalmed, do not putrifie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                  <p>Some perhaps may diſlike my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, becauſe they are ſhort, and becauſe of thoſe Examples which I uſe; but my Writings are not therefore to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing I uſe onely the examples of ſuch things which are or may be done by Nature; as in this compariſon of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals with the Body of Man: I know that there is great difference betwixt theſe two, yet they are both preſerved one way, as experience teacheth.</p>
                  <p>If a dead Body can be preſerved by Balſom from putrefaction or decay, how much more may a living Body be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>Now there are three parts of Mans Age, <hi>viz.</hi> yong Age, middle Age, and old Age; and each of theſe muſt have ſuch
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170174:201"/> Medicines for prolonging life, as are proper and ſuitable to them; therefore there muſt be alſo three kindes of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for the conſervation of Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe three Ages. We may likewiſe ſay that there are three parts in long life, according to thoſe three parts of mans Age: for many might die in their Infancy, many in their middle age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if their life were not prolonged by the help of Medicines.</p>
                  <p>We cannot have any certainty, that an Infant, or a ſtrong yong man ſhall outlive a weak old man: No part of mans age hath any certain time of death appointed to it; the Infant in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb may have many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal it, which may be the cauſe of great weakneſs in the childe, or incline the childe to diſeaſes; and that Infant which is very weak when it is born, the ſtrength of Nature is abated and leſſened in it, as it is in old age: And therefore thoſe Medicines which are the helps of long life, muſt be given to this Infant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing the Nurſes breaſt therewith, which the childe doth ſuck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you ſhall hear more at large afterwards in the practice of long life: For by theſe
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170174:201"/> Medicines of long life, the ſtrength of Nature is increaſed, and life prolonged, after the ſame maner in an Infant as it is in old age.</p>
                  <p>Or if a yong man runs into ſo great exceſs of Drinking or Venery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that thereby his body waſtes away, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture decays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we muſt uſe the ſame Method of curing him, which is uſed for prolonging life in old age; <hi>viz.</hi> by reſtoring the decayed ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and preſerving nature afterwards in its ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Old age begins with gray hairs, which if it be ſubject (as oft-times it is) to weakneſs and ſickneſs, it muſt be timouſly helped, and the Medicines of long life are to be uſed; but thoſe old people who are free from ſickneſs, and have much of the ſtrength of Nature, they are onely to uſe theſe Medicines accordingly as their neceſſity requireth.</p>
                  <p>Remember then this threefold parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the age of man, <hi>viz.</hi> Yong age, which begins with Infancy, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to the full growth of the Body; middle age, which begins when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is come to its full growth, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to the time of gray hairs; and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:170174:202"/> afterwards comes old age: Remember likewiſe, that each of theſe ages require ſuch Medicines of long life, which are proper, and moſt agreeable to them, as was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>It may be, this will be objected to me by the Emperick Phyſicians, that if we may have ſuch Medicines for preventing death, for curing diſeaſes, and prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life; how then comes it to paſs, that great men, as Princes, Kings, Emperors, Noblemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ordinarily live not ſo long as others? they are more ſubject to infirmities and diſeaſes then others, ſo that they live not out the half of their days. Certainly if there were any ſuch Medicines, theſe great men would have them.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the cauſes of this are well known to me and to thoſe of my way; we little regard ſuch vain, fooliſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned objections; yet I will anſwer it, that I may give ſatisfaction to all who deſire to be reſolved in it.</p>
                  <p>And we ſay, that we know not any King or Prince in our times, neither have heard nor read of any in former times, who have uſed theſe Medicines of long life, except onely <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus;</hi>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:170174:202"/> or if there have been others, they are not known to earthly men: This I do not ſpeak as in anſwer to the Objection, but my anſwer is this, That the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of Kings, Princes, Emperors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do know leſs in Phyſick they the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people, and this is the cauſe why they cannot bring health, but death to their Princes; and while Princes uſe the counſel of ſuch Phyſicians, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould enjoy health and long life: And this anſwer concerns thoſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Doctors, who have nothing of a Phyſician but the name.</p>
                  <p>I give another anſwer to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is this, That the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of great men is moſt often the cauſe of their ſhort lives; and this they have as part of the reward of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs: And this I think ſufficient for anſwer to this Objection.</p>

                  <p>YOu have heard, that as there is a threefold difference of mans Age, ſo there muſt be three kindes of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for each age hath its Medicines proper to it. Now I will ſhew you the ſeveral kindes of diſeaſes, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways of curing thoſe diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, Some diſeaſes come of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, diſorderly living, as Hydrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Jaundiſe, Gout, Falling-ſickneſs, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, &amp;c. and ſome diſeaſes come from the Times and Seaſons, &amp; other accidents concurring with diſorderly living, as Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Madneſs, &amp;c. Theſe kinds of diſeaſes are cured by the Medicines of long life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some diſeaſes are natural, which proceed of natural external cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and thoſe diſeaſes are to be cured by natural Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Some diſeaſes are unnatural, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as come by Inchantments, Superſtitions,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170174:203"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I wiſh our Phyſicians not to meddle with ſuch diſeaſes, for they ſeem to me to come upon people by Gods permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as puniſhments; and if ſo, they are not curable.</p>
                  <p>I know much may be done in this caſe by Images Rings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of life of which I wil not ſpeak here: I have ſpoken of them elſewhere, for it belongs to Aſtronomy to treat of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Diſeaſes which proceed not from the nature of the Body, or from weakneſs, but otherwiſe, they muſt be cured before you uſe the preſerving Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; if the diſeaſe be hidden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, you ought not to meddle with it; but if it be ſuch a diſeaſe as the Gout, Falling ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may be cured by uſing onely the preſerving Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Not to paſs over altogether thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which are from imagination, or by Superſtition, or by Inchantment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will here briefly ſhew you the cure of them, and how you may be preſerved from them. 1. Mental diſeaſes muſt be cured in a mental way. 2. Diſeaſes which are from our own imagination, muſt be cured by Objects. 3. Diſeaſes which are from the imagination of others, muſt be
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170174:204"/> cured by imagination. 4. Diſeaſes which come by Inchantments, muſt be cured by contrary Inchantments. 5. Diſeaſes which are cauſed by ſuperſtitious Charms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be cured by contrary Superſtitions.</p>
                  <p>Now the ways how we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from thoſe diſeaſes, are theſe: Firſt, Is to preſerve natural ſtrength. 2. To preſerve us from accidental diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. 3. From mental diſeaſes. 4. From Inchantments. 5. From Imaginations of others. 6. From our own Imaginations. 7. From Superſtitions.</p>
                  <p>You ſee, I make no mention of the four humors of the body in this buſineſs of long life, becauſe I finde, that the conſervation of the body and prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, is onely from the ſtrength of Nature, and not from the good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the four humors: Nay, in any cure the four humors are not to be regarded, but onely the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which reneweth and cheriſheth thoſe humors; and therefore that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who thinks by rectifying the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; to make up the defects of the ſtrength of Nature; he is like that man, who having ſuppreſſed the flame, thinks he hath quenched the fire, and leaves the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170174:204"/> live Coals. He who would preſerve a Tree, muſt be more careful of the root then the branches, becauſe the branches have all their nouriſhment and vertue from the root; and if we do any thing to the Branches when they are faulty, our principal aim therein, is to cheriſh the life and ſtrength of the root, for hence the branches have their life and vertue.</p>
                  <p>Now as the root of the Tree is to the branches, ſo is the ſtrength of nature to the humors of the body; ſo that if the humors of the body be diſtempered, we do not therefore loſe our health, unleſs by this diſtemper the root of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſtrength of nature be wronged; and therefore what we do in rectifying the diſtemper of humors, we do it for the conſervation and cheriſhing the ſtrength of Nature: This is the chief thing we aim at in the uſe of Medicine.</p>

                  <p>THat we may the better underſtand the nature of ſhort life &amp; long life, it is neceſſary that we conſider, firſt, what life is; ſecondly, which is the chief ſeat of life; thirdly, by what things life is ſhortned or lengthened.</p>
                  <p>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fe is not a body, but a thing ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, like hearing, ſeeing, ſmelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that which is a body, we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde it out by the courſe of Nature, whence it is; but we cannot finde out by the courſe of Nature, what ſight is, or what is the cauſe of ſight, or how it is effected; ſo neither can we finde out what life is, or how it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; for life comes not of natural ſeed, according to the ordinary courſe of nature, as the moſt part of natural things do, but it comes from a natural beginning, in a Spiritual and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary maner: As for example, we ſtrike fire with a ſteel and a flint, and yet there
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170174:205"/> is no fire either in the ſteel or flint, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they of a fiery nature, either by their predominant Element or their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; they are bodies which will not yield to fire, they are not eaſily conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by fire; they ſeem to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſiſt fire, and yet we can bring fire from them: After the ſame maner life comes from theſe things, in which there is no life, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeed, root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even as the fiery ſparks comes from the flint, in which there is no fire.</p>
                  <p>Now let us conſider, whether or not the life can be lengthned, amended or ſtrengthned, ſeeing it is incorporal: It is like fire, which having more wood, burns more vehemently: So life, the more it hath of the humor of life, ſo much the more the Spirit of life abounds.</p>
                  <p>But that fire ſhould come from that, in which there is no fire, the reaſon of this we cannot know: Many do think that the hardneſs of the flint and ſteel, is the cauſe of theſe fiery ſparks which comes from them, and ſo they reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: But by this anſwer they do not yet ſatisfie our queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> How any thing can come from that in which it never was.</p>
                  <p>The life (as I ſaid before) is like a flame,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170174:206"/> which feeding upon Wood or Oyl, and fat ſubſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it were living in them, viſibly repreſents life to us; and as a flame decaying is renewed again by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, when the flame is gone, and there is onely live coals, yet by larger additions of ſuitable matter, the flame ſhall become greater then it was before: So the life is ſtronger or weaker, according to the goodneſs or badneſs of that whereby the life is continued; ſo that according to nature we may refreſh and cheriſh life, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it with thoſe things, which are agreeable and delightſom to it, whereby it is made ſtronger, and of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. We ought not then to think the time of mans life is ſo determined, that every man muſt needs die ſuch a day and ſuch an hour; nor is it ſuitable to Chriſtianity, to think this, that the life cannot be prolonged by theſe Medicines which God hath created to this purpoſe: God hath created theſe Medicines for our uſe, and he hath granted us a liberty to uſe them; the defect is onely in us, that we do not know thoſe Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Mans reaſon is very weak, it fails in moſt things; we are much ſhort in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170174:206"/> of things good or hurtful to us; how few men know the largeneſs of that power which God hath granted to man? <hi>Adam</hi> knew all thoſe things perfectly, he was the wiſeſt of Mortal men, and he had continued immortal, if he had not been deprived of the Tree of Life; the which Tree of Life hath its place in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as well as in Divinity; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it was the Tree of Life, yet it was a natural Tree.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How the Life is prolonged by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the place where we live? by the four Elements? by the Stars? and by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Herbs?</head>
                  <p>THe third thing I promiſed to ſpeak of, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew you thoſe things by which life in lengthned or ſhortned.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, The <hi>Place</hi> where we live,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170174:207"/> makes much for the prolonging or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our life: There is great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Countreys, Climates, Cities, Mountains, Valleys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some are far more agreeable to long life then others; in ſome places there is better Air, they yield more delight, the vapors which riſe out of the ground more wholeſom, &amp;c. then in other places.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Elements, viz. Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, work great chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in life, ſometimes to the better, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the worſe. Out of the Earth groweth every thing which nouriſheth our Bodies, and that alſo which deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Bodies: We have from the earth not onely that which is hurtful to us, as poyſon, &amp;c. but we have alſo that which can cure us, and keep us from the harm of ſuch things, as Gold, Balm, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Do not think, that we have Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines created onely to cure diſeaſes; for if ſo, then Medicines could have no operation in Bodies which are ſound and whole, but experience proves this to be falſe: You muſt know this, that the Earth brings forth not onely ſuch things which can deſtroy us, or take away our health, but alſo gives us Medicines, which
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170174:207"/> not onely can cure our diſeaſes, but alſo can preſerve our life and health: Meat and drink, if rightly uſed, they are the means to preſerve our life, but if abuſed, they deſtroy life, as it appears oft-times by the effects of Drunkenneſs and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony; for whatſoever we have from any of the Elements may be good or hurtful to us, accordingly as it is uſed.</p>
                  <p>Again obſerve, That what damage we receive by one Element, it is recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by another Element: Water doth reſiſt fire, and by this reſiſtance it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth things that they are not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſuming heat of fire; and if there be any damage by fire or water, the Air will make amends; the Air will not forſake us, nor leave life, if we do not firſt forſake it: Sometimes the Air is infected, and by its infection may kill us; but we may eaſily know when it is infected, and ſo we may preſerve our ſelves from it, if we leave it and go where there is a better Air.</p>
                  <p>Here obſerve this difference in Air, and the reſt of the Elements; there is a general Air, and a particular Air; a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral water, &amp;c. Now of particular Airs, one may be good and another bad, alſo
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:170174:208"/> one piece of earth is better then another, and ſome water better then other water; ſo alſo fire, ſome is uſeful, and ſome is hurtful, as Lightning, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Stars have a great and powerful influence upon the life and health of Man, they can make ſick, they can reſtore health, they can preſerve health, they can bring death, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long life: There is no kinde of thing in the world, but there are ſome good and ſome evil of that kinde: Then here ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the main buſineſs, how to get the good, and eſchew the evil; we cannot have always that which we would, as if we would appropriate the influence of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to our ſelves; or if we would turn away from us the influence of <hi>Mars;</hi> or if we would draw to our ſelves the influences of ſuch other Stars which are good: Now this we cannot do, as we can chooſe one herb and leave another. I ſay, we cannot do thus with the ſtars, to keep off the influence of one, and chooſe the influence of another, as we pleaſe: But thus much we may do, if we obſerve the Sar before it put out its influence, what is the moſt likely way of that influence, viz. to what work,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:170174:208"/> buſineſs, &amp;c. it enclines moſt; and if it enclines to a buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that nature as ours is, then we may by certain helps (as thoſe Images, Rings, &amp;c. which are made for the Planets) draw the influence of that Star to work with us and aſſiſt us; but theſe things I declare more fully elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, many Herbs have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lurking in them, which can keep the life of man vigorous and flouriſhing for many ages; for Herbs have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible eſſence, the which when the Body of the Herb periſheth, it entreth into ſome other Herb of the ſame k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nde, or it remains incorruptible in the earth: If we receive the eſſence of an Herb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Bodies, it ſtayeth with us till our Bodies periſh and be putrified, and then it enters into the earth: So likew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he eſſence and properties of Mans body, leaves the body when it putrifieth. Here we muſt remember the difference which is betwixt the property of the Herb, and the eſſence of the Herb; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the property of Hellebore makes Hellebore to be ſuch an Herb, differing from all other Herbs, to have ſuch and ſuch vertues, as Laxative, &amp;c. So that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:170174:209"/> the property of Hellebore can be in no other thing then Hellebore; and when we receive the Hellebore, or eſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce of the Hellebore into our body, yet we do not receive the property of Hellebore. The eſſence of Hellebore is the pureſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſubſtance of it, containing the life, &amp; all the vertues of the Hellibore in the higheſt degree: Now when we take this eſſence inwardly, it mixeth it ſelf inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably with that humor which is the chief ſeat of our life, and preſerveth this humor from deſtructive alterations; and ſo long as this eſſence laſteth in us, it doth us good; it is of it ſelf durable, yet by the infection of our corruptible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors wherewith it is mixed, it grows weaker, and waſteth in time; as Talce, which cannot be conſumed by fire, yet it may be conſumed otherwiſe in length of time.</p>
                  <p>I will here adde one thing further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vertue of the place where we live, viz. That there are ſome places which do ſo agree with the humor of life, and do ſo preſerve it, that thoſe who live there, enjoy a wonderful long life; and there are ſome other places which makes them immortal who live there. The
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:170174:209"/> World may be divided into two parts, the one part is the place of Mortality, where we Mortals live in hope of Immortality by Grace; the other part of the World is Paradiſe, where death cannot be; for whatſoever is there, it is incorruptible naturally, and not by a Miracle: As our Phyloſophick gold preſerveth from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, &amp;c. ſo it is the nature of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to preſerve from death, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath its firſt being there, it is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly undecayable in all its ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>But we who live in this place of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, we have an incorruptible eſſence; and we have a corruptible Body, which can both be preſerved without decaying in Paradiſe. I will not write much of this, becauſe I have but little experience of it, for the eſſence of Earth is the center of our experience, and Paradiſe is far beyond our Travels; ſo that what I ſpeak of it, I ſpeak ſpiritually, as in a dream, rather then waking, ſignifying to you, that life is there perpetual, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to the end of the world; or if longer, that is unknown to us.</p>
                  <p>But that you may more fully know how health and long life may be preſerved, you muſt conſider the cauſes of health,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:170174:210"/> and the cauſes of diſeaſes; now health, and all diſeaſes are either from the minde or from the body. The minde is the cauſe of ſuch diſeaſes which come by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, or our own imagination, or the imagination of another, or the influence of the Stars: For when Imagination or Inchantment take hold of the minde, and make an impreſſion upon it, ſo as the minde is diſturbed, and thoughts multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and grow ſo ſtrong, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reaſon; then at laſt, by the power of that Imagination or Inchantment, Reaſon is quite overthrown, and ſo the evil operation of the Inchantment or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination prevails, and thereby diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are bred. Thus alſo the influence of the Stars may overcome the minde, and command it, howbeit it be not bred in the minde, nor depend of the minde, as the former, viz. Inchantment and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet it may powerfully encline the minde to good and bad operations; as the Sun which pierceth through the glaſs, and changeth that which is in the glaſs according to its own nature. The other cauſe of health and diſeaſes is the Body, viz. The humors or complexions of the Body, or ſome predominant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:170174:210"/> or ſome principal member of the Body; the Complexions are from the Body, and are ſeated in thoſe humors whereby the Body is ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>I will not here deſcribe thoſe diſeaſes, I conceive it not neceſſary, neither will I here ſtay to diſcover to you the nature and cauſes of the minde and body, or to tell you what choler is, or what blood is, or what Phlegm is, or what Melancholy is, but I will onely give you a hint of thoſe things in general.</p>

                  <p>I Now come to the Practice, and firſt I will ſpeak of natural remedies which are for thoſe diſeaſes, whereof the Body is the cauſe; and afterwards I will ſhew
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170174:211"/> you how theſe diſeaſes which come from the minde, are to be cured; which are not to be cured by natural remedies, but they muſt be cured in ſuch a way as is proper to them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, to preſerve us from bodily diſeaſes, we muſt have reſpect chiefly to the humor of life, which upholds the body, &amp; governs the complexions of the body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; if it be kept in good caſe, the Body is thereby preſerved: We need not be careful how we may renew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions and Qualities of the Body, or how to purge out hurtful or ſuperfluous humors, or how to cure the diſeaſes of the Liver, or Milt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Medicines which we uſe for long Life, can do all this; yea, whatſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or diſeaſe is in the Body, they can throughly cure it, and this they do, not by that great vertue they have which is proper to the preſervation of the humor of life, and prolonging of life, but by their incorruptible eſſence.</p>
                  <p>In this practice of preſerving the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, three things are to be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> The government of the Body, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Body, the Medicine it ſelf whereby the Body is preſerved: As for
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170174:211"/> the Government of the Body in reſpect of the Country or place where we live, it is not ſo much conſiderable as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two; indeed the chief thing that we are here to conſider, is the Medicine, and the right ordering of it: All our confidence is in this Medicine, for this preſerves both man and beaſt; this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves man however it findes him, yong or old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will not ſuffer any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity or corruption to be in the Body, and it doth ſo guard the body, that no outward diſeaſe which comes by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, or from the influence of the Stars, or the Imagination of another, can enter into the Body; neither will it ſuffer any Tartar to ſtick to any part of the Body, or to ſtop any paſſage in the Body; and if there be any Tartar any where, it takes it away.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt tell you, that he who hath but a vulgar underſtanding, cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe remedies of long Life, which I ſet down here: They onely can underſtand them who know the art, or to whom I declare my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>This following preſervative Medicine, which I will now deſcribe to you, it
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170174:212"/> is to be uſed thus: Take a dram of this Medicine in a draught of good Wine once a Moneth, if nature be not too much weakned by age; but if nature be much decayed, you muſt take a dram of this Medicine once a week; and when a man comes to fourſcore years and ten, or a hundred years of age, then he muſt take a dram of this Medicine every third day: This is to be well remembred, that you muſt uſe more or leſs of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, accordingly as you have more or leſs of the ſtrength of Nature; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe men who are come to the vigorous part of their age, we ſee the ſtrength of Nature greater in ſome then in others, ſome of them more able then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to endure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore this preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Medicine muſt be uſed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I have ſaid already. Nature is ſo weak in ſome that it cannot be preſerved, as thoſe who bring this weakneſs with them from the Womb, in whom the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature was never ſound nor ſure; and therefore this preſervative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine cannot be ſo effectual to ſuch, as to thoſe who have a firm foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that defect which is in them, which makes them incapable of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:170174:212"/> of this Medicine; as we ſee in Stone and Wood in taking fire, the ſtone cannot take fire ſo well as Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Woman uſe this Cordial Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, it will make her Courſes continue with her even in old age, yea, and make her fit to conceive and bare children, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe be naturally barren; for their Spirit of life being ſtrengthned by this Medicine, drives out of their Body whatſoever is contrary to it, and makes every thing in the body be as it ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>If a woman uſe this Medicine when ſhe is with childe, that childe ſhall have thereby a very ſound and good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
                  <p>Seeing long life depends upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life which preſerveth life, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the humors of life, whence ariſe the Complexions and Qualities, as ſeveral Branches from one root; therefore we have framed our preſervative Medicine according to this, <hi>viz.</hi> to rectifie the Spirit of Life and the humors of Life, and ſo the minde is alſo defended from hoſe troublers of Reaſon which ariſe from the Complexions, as ſadneſs, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſive joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we need not then uſe
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:170174:213"/> ſeveral remedies for ſeveral humors; this one is ſufficient to keep thoſe humors from diſtemper, or any unnatural alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to keep the body ſound and well, and to keep the minde free from all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances.</p>
                  <p>I will now deſcribe to you our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Medicine for long Life, ſo often mentioned; it conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> of Simples, and of Arcana or Quinteſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; we would not have the Simples and the Quinteſſences to be uſed ſeverally, but we joyn them together in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt; for the Simples have wonderful vertues, yea almoſt equal to the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſences in prolonging of life; there are ſome ſimples which can preſerve the Life forty years, and ſome Simples can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Life an hundred years.</p>
                  <p>As the leaves of Hellebore, which can preſerve the life an hundred and twenty years: I have declared the vertues of it in that Book which I have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of things: here I will not write much of it, becauſe of peoples unbelief, for whatſoever is not ordinary, it can hardly be believed.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe flowers of Secta Croa can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the life an hundred years; there
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170174:213"/> be many more no leſs admirable Vertues in thoſe Herbs, which I will not mention in this place; but the Quinteſſences in our Receit have a greater faculty in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, then thoſe Herbs, for they can ſtrengthen, comfort and nouriſh the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical humor, or the humor of life, more then the herbs; even as fleſh and herbs do both nouriſh a man, but not alike, for the one yields more nouriſhment and ſtrength then the other; Nature doth more delight in it, and receiveth it with greater benefit: Now my preſervative Medicine or Receipt of prolonging life in men or women for two or three ages, it is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the Quinteſſence of Gold, and the Quinteſſence of Pearls, of each half an ounce, of the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Saffron, of the Quinteſſence of Celandine, and of the Quinteſſence of Balm, of each five drams, of the leaves of the herb Hellebore, and of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Herb <hi>Secta Croa;</hi> let them be mixed together according to art, then put them in a glaſs bottle for your uſe, keeping them cloſe from the air.</p>

                  <p>HAving in the former Chapter deſri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed our preſervative Medicine, which is for the preſervation of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to preſerve us from thoſe diſeaſes whereof the Body is the cauſe: I will in this laſt Chapter ſhew you how to cure the diſeaſes of the minde, viz. Thoſe diſeaſes which proceed from the minde, as alſo thoſe diſeaſes whereby the minde it ſelf is infected, which are all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under one of theſe five. 1. The diſeaſes which come from the influence of the Stars. 2. Diſeaſes which are from Witchcraft or Inchantment. 3 Diſeaſes effected by the power of Imagination.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170174:214"/> 4. Diſeaſes which are produced by our own Thoughts. 5. Diſeaſes which are cauſed by Superſtition.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, to ſhew you how thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which come from the influence of the Stars are to be cured; howbeit we cannot know the nature, or cauſes, or power of the Stars, and therefore we cannot ſay any thing of it; yet we ſpeak of thoſe effects which are viſible, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the influence of the Stars, and we ſay, that the Stars have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing power upon the minde of Man, and their operations are ſo ſtrong that they overturn the minde, oppreſs it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We cannot hinder the motions of the Stars, nor can we hinder them to put forth their Influence, yet we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſelves from that influence: As thoſe who are in a Town beſieged, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they cannot hinder the Enemy to fire his Guns upon them, yet they may preſerve themſelves from the harm of the ſhot, by keeping themſelves within the Walls: So we may keep off the evil influences of the Stars, by thoſe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives which may be prepared for that purpoſe: Now you muſt remember, that there are two kindes of Influences; there
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170174:215"/> is one kinde of influence which is good and neceſſary to us; that as the body is ſuſtained by nouriſhment, even ſo we are ſuſtained, ſtrengthned, and preſerved by this good influence; there is another kinde of influence which is hurtful to us, this hinders the former good influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it cannot have any operation upon us to do us good; and againſt thoſe hurtful influences, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide defenſives to preſerve us from their harm: Thoſe defenſives are the Rings and Images of the Planets, which are made according to the influence, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are made in the time of a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, I do not deny, but that the Rings of the Planets (as I have ſhewed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, treating of Imagination) have a power to preſerve us, and are helpful to the prolonging of life; yet I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them for many reaſons, which I will not mention now.</p>
                  <p>The beſt way how we may preſerve our ſelves from the evil influences of the Stars, I conceive it is this, <hi>To turn off the influence from our ſelves, to another thing which will eaſily yield to the Influence:</hi> as for example, If ſome evil Star, as <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp;c. be enclined to ruine me, and this
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170174:215"/> inclination hath made ſome Impreſſion upon my minde, and begins to infect it, whereby I may fall into ſome diſeaſe of the minde; then I muſt make an Image like a man, upon which the evil influence may have its operation, and ſo I my ſelf may be ſaved from the harm of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: For a Star being enclined to ruine me, and finding ſome agreement betwixt me and this Image, and that it hath a readier way to fall upon this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and hath leſs reſiſtance in this Image then it ſhould have in me; therefore it leaves me who am more difficult to work upon, and chooſeth the Image which is more eaſie, where it fulfils its operation with delight: There may be many other reaſons given why the influence removes thus from the perſon againſt whom it was intended, to the Image; but I will not now expreſs them, for they are not pertinent to the purpoſe in hand.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing of which I am to ſpeak, is to ſhew you how we may be preſerved from the harm of Witch-craft, that our life be not ſhortned by it: I have in many other of my writings ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remedies for Witch-craft; but you ſhall uſe the ſame way here for Witch-craft
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:170174:216"/> and Inchantment, as you have been taught before for the evil influences of the Stars; for Witch-craft or Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath the ſame way of working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our minde or Body, as the evil influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars: But here we muſt uſe another kinde of Object, upon which the operat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of Witch-craft muſt be turned, then that which is uſed for the influences of the Stars: Thus I do, I make an Image of Wax like a Man, which I ſet in its own place; and whatſoever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is intended againſt me by Witch-craft, it ſhall be removed from me to that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and there it will be accompliſhed; for the Inchantment proceeding from the minde of the Witch againſt me, my minde keeps it ſtrongly off, and turns it upon the Image, whereby there can be no harm done on either ſide.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is, how we may ſave our ſelves from the harm of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of others; I may be killed by an others Imagination, if it be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me, if it be not turned ſome other way from me: I will explain this to you by an example; Suppoſe I have an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who hath an extream hatred againſt me, ſo that he exceedingly deſires my
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:170174:216"/> death daily, he is no Witch, but onely a violent enemy; and this I do not know, that he hath any ſuch malice againſt me: Now what muſt I do, that this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrong me not: Certainly the beſt courſe that I can take for this, is thus, to ſettle my minde and to keep it in quiet, free from all paſſions or diſturbance as much as poſſibly I can, not deſiring any revenge, or to do any wrong to any, and by this good temper of my minde, the others malicious imagination againſt me ſhall be thus overcome, that it cannot do any harm to me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whereas our own thoughts do oft-times wrong us, as when I think my judgement too weak for ſuch a thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by this thought my reaſon is quite overcome, and I loſe my reaſon with it, as I have ſhewed more largely elſewhere: Now the beſt help for ſuch thoughts, is this, <hi>Not to put more upon our reaſon, then it can eaſily perform;</hi> and ſo we ſhall not be troubled with ſuch thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Another way to help theſe thoughts, is thus, If we conceive any thing to be much without the reach of our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this we may uſe the ſame Image, which we uſe for the influences of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:170174:217"/> the Stars; and the Image ſtanding in our ſtead, and is as it were the ſame with us; then thoſe thoughts which would have wronged us, will vaniſh, and they will paſs from us to the Image, for the Image cannot make any reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe thoughts, and there they may be fulfilled without any harm.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, By the thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations many Superſtitions are made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, which differ much from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment or imagination: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, When I hear a Raven upon the top of my houſe, then I have a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious thought, that this muſt be a ſign of death in my houſe; now this Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thought growing ſtrong, may either cauſe ſickneſs, or the death of one who is ſick in my houſe; the truth of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears oft-times by experience, and I have given the reaſons of this in my Treatiſe of Superſtitions. The way to prevent the harm of ſuch Superſtitions, is thus, I muſt perſwade my judgement, that ſuch ſuperſtitious thoughts are vain and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; and what I eſteem to be a certain ſign of ſuch or ſuch a thing to come to paſs, that this is my error, I muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to convince my Judgement of it, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:170174:217"/> I muſt be always careful to exalt my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above groundleſs conceits, and not to entertain thoughts upon the report or phanſies of others, nor to conform my thoughts to vulgar opinions; as when I hear the croaking of a Raven upon my houſe, I muſt think no otherwiſe of this, but that it is onely the natural act of the Raven, which ſignifieth no more to me upon my houſe, then in any other place; and thus this ſuperſtitious thought is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and made ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>A ſtrong conceit of the truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſuperſtitious thoughts, is the cauſe which oft-times makes them have their effect; but if I examine theſe thoughts by reaſon, and ſo come to ſee their groundleſneſs, vanity and folly, this will quite deſtroy them, and prevent that evil which they might effect.</p>
                  <p>This I conceive is enough for thoſe cures of the diſeaſes of the minde: If any do not underſtand theſe things which I have written here concerning long Life, it is becauſe they can neither perceive what I ſay, nor what Nature doth: I do not intend to make thoſe things plainer to them; for what I have written here, I have written it onely for
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170174:218"/> thoſe who are grounded in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch things, and it is my deſire that they may fully underſtand me.</p>
                  <p>If you would know what Dyet is beſt for long life, obſerve theſe rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 1. Let your meats and drinks be prepared with the preſervative Medicine, and this will drive out all ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which lurk in the Body. 2. If you have any inward diſeaſes, then you muſt ſpeedily uſe fit Medicines, as Quinteſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. to ripen them: Concerning the cauſes of diſeaſes, and their proper remedies I will not write any thing here, for that I have done in many other of my Phyſical Treatiſes. 3. The beſt Dyet for long life, is a moderate dyet, which I need not deſcribe here, ſeeing it is ſo well known to every Phyſician. 4. Let your meats and drinks be rightly prepared, that is, They muſt be purged from all ſuperfluities, impurities, and whatſoever is hurtful in them; and this is to be done the ſame way, which is uſed in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Elements, as I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in my Book concerning Reſtauration and Renovation: Such purified meats and drinks, with a moderate dyet, are wonderfully helpful to the prolonging
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170174:218"/> of life; they nouriſh well, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cauſe any diſeaſe in the Body; this cannot be ſaid of other meats and drinks.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Obſerve, That thoſe purified meats and drinks yield better nouriſhment to our Bodies, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they do encreaſe fleſh and good blood very much, this is their uſe; and the uſe of their preſervative Medicine is to preſerve the ſpirit of Life and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of life.</p>
